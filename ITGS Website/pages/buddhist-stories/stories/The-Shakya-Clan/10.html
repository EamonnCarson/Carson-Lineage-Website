"No. If I stop killing the Shakya clan, I will have to live in shame. I cannot stop this. But I spare your life. Just go away anywhere you want."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Please accept my wish then."<br>
</p>
<p>
"What is it? Tell me."<br>
</p>
<p>
"I am going to dive into this pond. Please stop all your soldiers from killing until I come up to the surface of the pond"<br>
"All right. As soon as you come up, I will kill them all."<br>
</p>
<p>
Mahanama quickly jumped into the pond and he tied up the roots of a tree at the bottom of the pond with his hair.<br>
5, 10, 20 minutes passed... He had not come up to the surface yet.<br>
"What is going on? Take a look at under the water."<br>
Mahamana was already dead at the bottom of the pond. But during this, a large number of the people were able to escape.<br>
Soon the massacre restarted.<br>

This is the tragedy that happened during the late years of the Buddha, possibly a year before he passed away.<br>
The Shakya clan became almost extinct. Survivors were a few who scattered away mostly lay follower students and woman students (nuns).<br>
Through this sad incident, the Buddha meditated harder and harder.<br>
He realized that it is necessary that his teachings be such that they enable not only the Buddhist monks, but also for the lay followers, to practice cutting bad karma and achieving enlightenment.<br>
</p>
<p>
"It may be difficult in this era, but there will be a time where everyone can practice."<br>
</p>
<p>
His compassionate eyes had perceived the people in the distant future.<br>
Thus, the Buddha made his mind firmly to expound Mahaparinirvana Sutra.<br>
The Buddha started his final journey toward the sala grove in Kushinagana, quietly gazing at the future.
