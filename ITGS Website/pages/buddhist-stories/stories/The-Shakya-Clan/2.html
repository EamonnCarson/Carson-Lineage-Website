"What if I accept a new wife from a noble family of the Shakya clan?<br>
If so, the Buddhist students will feel comfortable staying here like Buddhist families' homes.<br>
The Shakya clan is historically of noble birth and this will also enhance the dignity of my royal family.<br>
It must be a good idea."

<p>
Then he immediately sent a messenger to Kapilavastu (the capital of the Shakya clan).<br>
In the royal family of the Shakya clan, however, no one welcomed the proposal.<br>
It was because the Shakya clan had a lot of pride, as they were descendants of the legendary Holy King back in the Veda era (1500BC - 600BC).<br>
Even though Kosala was the Shakya clan's dominant country, they looked down on King Pasenadi as an upstart.<br>
But they could not decline the proposal.<br>
</p>
<p>
"We have to give him a bride," said one.<br>
"Then Pasenadi will take over us," said another.<br>
The members of the royal family of Shakya were lost in thought.<br>
</p>
<p>
Then Mahanama said, <br>
"I have a good idea.<br>
I had my servant (slave) give birth to a girl, Vasabhakhattiya, who is now marriageable and she is so beautiful that it is as if she were from a noble family.<br>
How about giving her to him as the bride from the Ksatriyas (one of the caste ranks)?<br>
For me, as her father, in fact she is from the Kasatriyas anyway."<br>
"Well, let's do it," all said.
