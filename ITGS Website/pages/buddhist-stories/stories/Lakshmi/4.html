<p>
Mahakassapa nodded with the expression that he had understood the moral behind the Buddha's story. But the other disciples who were not so keen did not understand it.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Is it really wise to drive away the both sisters?"<br>
 Since the older sister (Lakshmi) is more important for us, is it wise to put up with the younger sister (Alakshmi) and serve her?
Or should we come up with an idea to drive away the younger sister?"<br>
</p>
<p>
Then the Buddha kindly explained to them:<br>
</p>
<p>
 "The older sister represents birth (life) and the younger sister represents old age, sickness, and death.<br>
It is inevitable that birth (life) is always accompanied by old age, sickness, and death. But heretics always wish to be given a birth (life) in heaven.<br>
A fool clings to birth (life) without knowing that sufferings of old age, sickness, and death are always with him, and he is greedy like the miserable man in the story.<br>
A Bodhisattva has discarded birth (life) and death, and thus without any attachments.<br>
Therefore, a Bodhisattva is free and has obtained peace like the wealthy man in the story." <br>
</p>
<p>
Then all the disciples gave affirmative nods.<br>
