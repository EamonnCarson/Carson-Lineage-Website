Chunda asked: <br>
</p>
<p>
"Manjusri, the Tathagata is the most honored and most supreme of the heavens above or among men. <br>
How can such a Tathagata be the same as changing and varying phenomena? <br>
Do you mean, He is just like water bubbles, arising quickly and quickly ceasing? <br>
You should not regard the Tathagata in such a way. <br>
Manjusri, do you speak in that way with understanding the Buddha, or do you speak in that way without understanding Him? <br>
You should not say, only with your realization in your head, that the Tathagata would also be the same as changing and varying phenomena."<br>

"For instance, there is a wealthy elder's son who is sickly and may have a short life, and upon his parents' knowing this, he would not be able to continue the family lineage, and his parents would never again cherish him. <br>
Manjusri, do you see the Tathagata be the same? <br>
If so, there would be no one who could succeed this unchanging unvarying dharma of universal truth. <br>
Manjusri, if one wishes to protect the true dharma, he shall not say that the Tathagata is the same as phenomena or not the same as phenomena.<br>
Rather, he should deeply reflect himself and claim, 'I am now deluded and do not yet possess the wisdom eye.' <br>
The Tathagata's true dharma is inconceivable."
