	Surprisingly, the Buddha just said that He would accept the offerings from this young man, though He had not taken even the marvelous offerings from all kinds of people, from the deities, and from the great-bodhisattvas of all buddhist countries. <br>
	There occurred an excitement among the congregation. <br>
	Upon hearing the Buddha's acceptance of the very last offerings from Chunda, the congregation, though they had felt dejected and been sitting without a word, was elated, danced joyfully, and praised Chunda: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"How wonderful, how wonderful, Chunda!" <br>
	"The Buddha understood your true heart." <br>
	"We genuinely praise and respect you in the same way we look up to and admire the pure, bright full moon of an autumn sky." <br>
	"You are truly a child of the Buddha and no different from His son, Rahula." <br>
	"Now please beg the Buddha to stay in this world longer and to teach the supreme dharma for all beings." <br>
</p>
<p>
	Chunda was, of course, elated and his face was beaming with joy as if his deceased parents had suddenly come back to life. <br>
	And he reverently bowed before the Buddha, recited the verses (gathas) and asked Him to stay in this world longer. <br>
	His request, however, could not overturn the Buddha's decision of entering into Nirvana. <br>
	The World Honored One had taught that all phenomena are impermanent, thus one should not cling to his or her physical body which is a cause of sufferings. <br>
	It is as a matter of course because the Buddha's true body is the dharma-body, which is eternal and detached away from all the sufferings.<br>
