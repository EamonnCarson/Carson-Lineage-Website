	Chunda continued: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"World Honored One, it certainly is as you have said. <br>
	What wisdom I have is quite shallow, like that of mosquitoes. <br>
	How could I possibly conceive of that core meaning of the Tathagata's Nirvana? <br>
	But, my joy given by the Buddha's loving kindness and compassion is as much as Manjusri's and other great-bodhisattvas'. <br>
	It is because of the spiritual power of the Buddha. <br>
	Therefore, World Honored One, I beg you to stay in this world longer and not enter Nirvana." <br>
</p>
<p>
	Then, Manjusri stood up after hearing his name was mentioned in Chunda's bold speech. <br>
	Manjusri was a bodhisattva who was realized to have great wisdom. <br>
	He was considered as a successor of the core of the Mahayana teachings and was also called the Dharma Prince Manjusri. <br>
</p>
<p>
	Manjusri advised Chunda: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"Now, Chunda, you should not ask for the Buddha in such a wrong way -- asking the Tathagata to stay long in life and not to enter Nirvana. <br>
	You should see the nature of all phenomena. Contemplating all phenomena, you will gain the samadhi of emptiness. <br>
	If you want to seek the right dharma, you should thus train yourself." <br>
</p>
<p>
	Hearing the words from Manjusri, Chunda daringly challenged a debate with Manjusri the boddhisattva of Wisdom. <br>
	His young burning dharma-seeking heart drove him in that way.
