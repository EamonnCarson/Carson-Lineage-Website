<p>
	This is a story about something that happened long, long ago, when Shakyamuni Buddha relayed the last of his teachings in the sala grove. <br>
</p>
<p>
	Soon after they heard the World Honored One was about to pass away into Nirvana, countless people came to the sala grove in Kushinagar. <br>
	They ranged from royalties to common people. And also, there were heavenly deities, asuras, and devils. In addition to that, animals were also seen. <br>
	They came to see the Buddha, even if just a glance, and to make their last offerings. <br>
	Whatever marvelous offering was presented, however, the Buddha did not accept any. <br>
	They felt dejected by the Buddha's refusal and sat without a word. <br>
