<p>
Chunda replied, <br>
</p>
<p>
    "Manjusri, why do you now covet these foods and say 'many, few, sufficient, or insufficient' in order to lead me to offer right away? <br>
</p>
<p>
"Manjusri, do you really mean to say that the Tathagata who is truly awakened will accept these foods? <br>
</p>
<p>
"Verily, I resolutely know that the body of the Tathagata is the dharma-body and not an foods-eating body." <br>
</p>
<p>
Chunda seized upon the point of the debate, there was nothing Manjusri could say. <br>
At that time, the Buddha addressed Manjusri, saying, "It is so, it is so." <br>
He likewise said to Chunda, "Excellent, Chunda! You have brought to fruition the subtle and wondrous great knowledge and skillfully entered the most profound Mahayana scriptures." <br>
Finally the Buddha agreed with Chunda, which meant that Chunda was correct. <br>
</p>
<p>
Now Manjusri had to admit that Chunda refuted him. <br>
Then he unwillingly spoke to Chunda, <br>
</p>
<p>
    "So it is, so it is. It is as you have said. It's not as though I did not know it. <br>
"Instead, my desire was only to test you against the bodhisattva work." <br>
</p>
<p>
At this point, whatever Manjusri said only sounded like his defense of his loosing in the debate. <br>
Thus, it was proved that Chunda was the right person to represent all the sentient beings and was qualified to provide the very last offerings to the Buddha. <br>
</p>
<p>
There had been no one else who refuted Manjusri, who was superior to the other great-bodhisattvas in wisdom. <br>
But Chunda, who was just one of the lay followers, actually refuted Manjusri. It was really amazing. <br>
The World Honored one showered His great compassion and loving kindness on Chunda, a young lay buddhist, and entrusted him with the future of the dharma. <br>
</p>
<p>
Since then, Chunda was recognized as a great-bodhisattva with whom none could match and he became a major figure who succeeded to the teachings of the Buddha's last will.
