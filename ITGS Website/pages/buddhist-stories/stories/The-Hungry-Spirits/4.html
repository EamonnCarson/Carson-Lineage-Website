	The Buddha continued:<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Listen, my disciples. That traveling preacher, after his death, fell into the Hell of Avici (one of the eight great hot hells) and had suffered there for an extremely long time. <br>
	He finally got out of the hell, but he became a hungry spirit because of his bad karma, and now he is wandering around as he looks."<br>
</p>
<p>
	After the Buddha finished the story, the disciples who had gathered and listened to him with their curiosity started to sigh.<br>
	"Oh, how terrible the outcomes of the bad deeds are!" said the disciples with their serious looks.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Then, Moggallana again mentioned: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"Actually, the Buddha, I have also seen another strange being.<br>
	On the other day, when I was going down the mountain, I saw a skinny being with no body skin flying over the sky. <br>
	And kites and crows were chasing and pecking it. The being went away with agony."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Well. You have seen it too, Moggallana. I have also encountered that being. <br>
	But I did not tell anybody about it because without divine eyes, no one would believe it." <br>
</p>
<p>
	"The Buddha, that is why I did not tell it, either.<br>
	I knew you would prove it exists. That's why I decided to tell about it."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"I see. My disciples, what Moggallana has just told us is true," said the Buddha.
