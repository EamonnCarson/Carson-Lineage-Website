	The hungry spirits' ugly bodies vanished by the high virtue of the donations and the Buddha's teaching. <br>
	They were able to be reborn in the thirty-three heavenly worlds.<br>
	Despite their previously ugly and pitiful appearances, now they live in the heavenly worlds joyfully and delightfully, like angels.<br>

	"How fortunate we are! Because of Moggallana, who made his effort to ask the Buddha and his disciples for the service with our relatives, we are able to stay in this marvelous heavenly worlds." <br>

	Then they descended from the heavenly worlds and approached from above of the Buddha while he was teaching at the Bamboo Grove as usual with Moggallana beside him.<br>
	As they showed their shining, brilliant appearances with the golden crowns, the jewelry accessories and the beautiful clothes on. <br>
	They honored the Buddha and Moggallana, and offered their true appreciation.<br>

<p>
	"My disciples, look at these angels shining brilliantly. These are what the hungry spirits we offered the service became."<br>
</p>
<p>
	The people there were amazed by the Buddha's words and looked at the angels. <br>
	They understood the importance of the dharma, and saw them off to the heavenly worlds.<br>
