	Being encouraged by the Buddha's words, Moggallana continued:<br>
</p>
<p>
	"In fact, the Buddha, I have also seen a different unusual creature. <br>
	The other day, when I was descending the mountain, I saw a strange being with hair made of needles and knives.<br>
	Whenever it moved, the sharp edged hair stabbed its body and cut the skin to bleed. <br>
	It was crying in pain while scavenging for kitchen waste and dirt. I couldn't help but gaze at it.<br>
	But I have kept silent because without divine eyes no one would believe it"<br>
</p>
<p>
	"I see. My disciples, I have seen that being, too. What Moggallana told us is true."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"And, the Buddha, I have seen another one too," said Moggallana. <br>
</p>
<p>
	"One day, I smelled something like a cesspool, when I was at the mountain.<br>
	I turned around and I saw a human-like being which had an inflated belly and very thin throat.<br>

<p>
	It was scavenging the excrement. It ran away when I approached it and I can still remember its miserable appearance."<br>
	The rest of the disciples asked: <br>
	"The Buddha, does such a being actually exist? Does it even smell?"<br>
