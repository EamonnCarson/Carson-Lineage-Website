	"The Buddha, please accept this service for the kin of this landlord who are in miserable circumstances at the spiritual world. <br>
	Using the virtues from this offering, please save them from being the hungry spirits."<br>

	Moggallana asked the Buddha for them and the Buddha accepted it willingly.<br>
	The Buddha embraced the hungry spirits with his divine power.<br>
	When he deepened his prayer, amazingly even the people without the divine eyes were able to see the hungry spirits.<br>
	Everyone was shocked by the sad appearances of the hungry spirits that Moggallana had seen; some took their breath away and some looked away from them.<br>

	When the Buddha saw that the people understood deeply, he preached that your actions driven by greed, stinginess and attachment could cause the suffering.<br>
	He also taught that to depart from the self-centered way and to act for others with your pure heart is the closest way to being bodhisattva and absolute comfort.<br>
	The people there started having religious belief and promised to take refuge in the Buddha, the dharma, and the sangha. <br>
	Some of them reached to the level of shrotapanna (stream-enterer or sudaon), which refers to a person who has entered one of the stages of faith leading to Buddhahood.<br>
