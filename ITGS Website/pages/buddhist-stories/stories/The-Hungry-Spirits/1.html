<p>
	Once upon a time when the Buddha was alive...<br>
</p>
<p> 
	There were many talented disciples under the Buddha, such as Sariputta, who was foremost in wisdom, and Moggallana, who had the divine eyes. <br>
	Because Moggallana had the divine eyes he experienced the unusual and observed other beings from the invisible world.<br>
	This is an episode from when the Buddha and his disciples lived in Rajagaha:<br>
</p>
<p>
	Moggallana had been training at Mt. Girddhakuta; one morning he and Lakkhana were descending the mountain toward Rajagaha to collect alms. <br>
	On their way Moggallana suddenly stopped, looked up the sky, and grinned. Then he started walking again as if nothing had happened.<br>
	Lakkhana, however, noticed his grin.<br>
</p>
<p>
	"My friend, Moggallana, why did you smile? You did it the other day, too. What was that all about?"<br>
</p>
<p>
	Lakkhana had noticed Moggallana's odd behavior that sometimes he had shown<br>
	"Please do not ask me now, Lakkhana. I will tell you in the presence of the Buddha."<br>
	Lakkhana didn't ask about it again.<br>
</p>
<p>
	After collecting alms, as soon as they finished breakfast, Lakkhana urged Moggalla and they headed to the Bamboo Grove where the Buddha stayed.<br>
	They offered vows and greeted the Buddha, and Lakkhana repeated his question.<br>
