	What the Buddha told was amazing:<br>
</p>
<p>
	A long time ago, there was a temple around here and two monks were training in harmony.<br>
	One day, a traveling preacher visited there.<br>
	They welcomed him and next day three of them went to collect alms.<br>
	The two monks thought the traveling preacher's speech would be new for the people in the village, so they asked him to preach.<br>
	As they thought, his sermon was very successful.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Since then, they started visiting the villages to collect alms with his sermons. <br>
	Because the preacher looked down on the two monks for he thought they were country people and they had no knowledge, he started to have a dark ambition to take over the temple.<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Sir, the other one of you seems a good person, but please be careful.<br>
	He always tells me negative things about you.<br>
	Please don't tell him that I told you about it. Because I trust you."<br>
	Occasionally he gave both of the monks such kind of idea.<br>
</p>
<p>
	The two monks, who had been worked in harmony, started avoiding each other and their relationship was getting awkward. <br>
	At last they started arguing over trifles and left the temple in opposite directions as if they did not want to see each other's faces. <br>
</p>
<p>
	"Sir, please do not leave, both of you. Please think this over again."<br>
</p>
<p>
	The traveling preacher pretended as though he had cared about them, but he was satisfied with the result; his plan worked.<br>
