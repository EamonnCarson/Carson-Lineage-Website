	Then Moggallana said:<br>
</p>
<p>
	"I will now tell you since we are in the Buddha's presence.<br>
	Actually, Lakkhana, at that time I had spotted a strange creature flying over the sky.<br>
	It had a fat pig-like body with a human head and a tail-like tongue with maggots at the end.<br>
	I couldn't help but smiling because of such an unusual form."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"What? Does such a thing exist?" Lakkhana asked with surprise, and the Buddha said:<br>
</p>
<p>
	"My disciples, in fact I have also seen that creature at Girddhakuta.<br>
	But anybody who does not have divine eyes wouldn't believe it even if I told him many times.<br>
	If one does not believe what I say, it will create a bad karma and he will suffer; that is why I have not told anybody about that creature."<br>

	Now the rest of the disciples showed up and asked:<br>
	"The Buddha, what on earth is it? Why does it have such an appearance?"<br>
</p>
<p>
	"My disciples, do you want to know what it is?"<br>
</p>
<p>
	"The Buddha, if you know what it is, please tell us."<br>
