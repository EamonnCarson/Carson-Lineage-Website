	"My disciples, I have seen that being, too. What Moggallana told us is true."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"The Buddha, what on earth is it? Why does it have such a look?" <br>
</p>
<p>
	"Well, my disciples, I will tell you a story about her karma."<br>
</p>
<p>
	The Buddha started the story: <br>
</p>
<p>
	A long time ago, there was a paccekabuddha (one who has reached his own enlightenment by practicing alone) nearby. <br>
	When he was practicing in the mountain, he became sick, and he visited a doctor and had himself examined.<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Sir, it would be the best for you to eat meat for treatment."<br>
</p>
<p>
	Following what the doctor said, the paccekabuddha went to a town and begged for meat at a religious landlord's house. <br>
	When the landlord's saw the paccekabuddha, he was willing to offer food, but he had to leave soon to go far away for business.<br>
	So he told his wife to do so:<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Instead of my doing so, provide the honorable paccekabuddha some good meat to accumulate virtue because I have to leave now."<br>
</p>
<p>
	"Don't worry, I will take care of it. So you can leave for your business."<br>
</p>
<p>
	The wife, however, was very stingy and she did not like giving alms.<br>
</p>
<p>
	"How shameless it is not to do any work. <br>
	If I give him food, I bet he will come everyday. I have to drive him back."<br>
