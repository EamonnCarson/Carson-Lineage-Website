It was Capa, the village leader's beautiful daughter, who cheered him up when he was in distress.<br>
By her carefree smile, her innocent looks when chanting, and her active young appearance, he was encouraged and he felt relieved.<br>
When the leader sensed Upaka's feelings, he asked.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Upaka, how do you think about my daughter?"<br>
</p>
<p>
"She is a good girl -- honest and joyous. And more, she is the most beautiful in the village."<br>
</p>
<p>
The leader was satisfied with Upaka's response, and then his face suddenly looked serious and said.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Upaka, I will give my daughter to you if you become a hunter in the village. What do you think?"<br>
</p>
<p>
Upaka's heart was shaking because he was in love with Capa.<br>
 He thought:<br>
 </p>
<p>
"Even it is called the sacred path, but I have not obtained any true happiness and satisfaction in my current training.<br>
I will be relieved a lot if I will be with Capa."<br>
</p>
<p>
Upaka made up his mind and he became a hunter.<br>
Soon his pretty child was born and he had spent many joyous days.<br>
He felt like he had gained a comfort and joy that he had never had before.<br>
