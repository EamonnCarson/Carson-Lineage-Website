<p>
Despite his expectation, however, his happiness was undependable and unstable.<br>
Capa used to look honest and pretty, but as she increased her impudence, her blunt speaking and formidable attitude became noticeable.<br>
He thought she was cheerful and frank, but now she looked indecent and uneducated. He felt like something was missing.<br>
Since his hastily-learned hunting skills had not improved much, he was not comfortable being the son-in-law of the village leader.<br>
And the more he killed the living beings, the farther he felt he was departing from the sacred world and the more he became uneasy.<br>
Gradually his mind was filled with frustration, anxiety, and irritation.<br>
</p>
<p>
"As I thought, happiness in the carnal world is never lasting? Eternal bliss is just an ideal after all?"<br>
Upaka's heart became discontented as it used to be.<br>
</p>
<p>
Then, a village man who met the Buddha during his trip just came back.<br>
He looked so excited and he said he had become a lay follower of the Buddha on the spot.<br>
Of course, the people in the village had already heard of the great saint, the Buddha. But nobody knew what kind of teachings the Buddha was preaching.<br>
</p>
<p>
Upaka asked him immediately.<br>
"Friend, what kind of teachings did the Buddha preach?"<br>
 "I've listened to a lot of graceful teachings from him. But the disciples said these are the most important:<br>
 	 We all suffer in life because we all have desires.<br>
We can obtain Nirvana if we discard our desires.<br>
This is the path to reach Nirvana."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Thank you. What is Nirvana, then?" Upaka asked.<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Well. It is eternal happiness that is never broken.
When I looked at the face of the Buddha, it was so blight that my body trembled.
He was like a god. I've been feeling joyous ever since."<br>
</p>
<p>
While Upaka was listening to the story, his encounter with the Buddha flashed across his mind. And so did theBuddha's words back then:<br>
</p>
<p>
"He who has thrown away delusions of all kinds could be a victorious one like me in life, Upaka."<br>
Upaka came to himself. The word "Upaka," he heard clearly.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Right. I've been thinking that I had missed a great opportunity, but the voice of the Buddha is still alive in me.<br>
Now at this time, I will follow the Victorious One, the Buddha."
