Upaka could not contain himself anymore. As soon as he got home, he told Capa.<br>
"I will become a monk to pursue the way."<br>
</p>
<p>
Capa, having thought that Upaka was in love with her, told him angrily.<br>
 "Upaka, you are angry at me, aren't you? <br>
It is said that one cannot pursue the way with anger.<br>
Oh, please calm down and come back to me.<br>
Shall we live with joy like we used to?<br>
I, as well as my relatives, will do whatever you say."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Capa, it would be very fortunate even if one quater of what you've said were true."<br>
Capa's attempt did not work at all.<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Look, Upaka.<br>
I look beautiful with perfume of sandalwood on my hands and feet, in fine clothes from Kasi, like an acacia tree with the beautiful flowers.<br>
So, are you still going to walk out on me?"<br>
</p>
<p>
"Women by using their appearance try to bind those who try to pursue the way.<br>
But one with wisdom will become a monk by discarding wealth and social rank.<br>
Like an elephant that cuts the rope that binds"<br>
</p>
<p>
Since Capa understood the Upaka's firm determination, she gave up convincing him and said.<br>
"Then, take care of yourself. Where are you going now?"<br>
</p>
<p>
 "I used to be an ascetic monk traveling around.<br>
I thought I had been walking on the true path back then.<br>
But there was no truth there.<br>
Now, however, the teacher supreme, the Buddha has appeared and he is expounding the teachings of truth.<br>
I will search for him and I will practice under him."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Then, when you meet the Buddha, please pray for me. Please give my offering to him, the teacher supreme." <br>
Upaka received the offering from Capa and he departed for the Buddha.<br>
