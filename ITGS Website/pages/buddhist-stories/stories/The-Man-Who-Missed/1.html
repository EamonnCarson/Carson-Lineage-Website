Once upon a time when the Buddha was alive...<br>
</p>
<p>
As usual, it was a hot afternoon. The new nuns were gathering around a nun, Capa, who was sitting under the shade of a tree. <br>
They came here to listen to her experience since she had attained enlightenment and become an Arahat.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Capa, what kind of life did you have before you became a nun? Could you tell us?"<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Well. First of all, I need to tell you about a very important person, who guided me to this profound teaching.
It was way back to the time when the World Honored One had attained enlightenment and became to be known as the Buddha."<br>
Capa started telling the story while gazing at the far sky.<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Shakyamuni Buddha, our teacher, due to his compassion, decided to expound the supreme enlightenment that he had attained. 
At first he had thoroughly considered about to whom he would preach the teaching since the teaching is so deep and so wide, and so subtle and so reverent. 
Finally he decided to preach to the five monks who had been his companions during his earlier austerities.
The Buddha started walking from Buddhagaya, near River Neranjara, toward Kasi, where these five were living.
On his way, he encountered a man. My story starts from here."<br>
</p>
<p>
The nuns were listening attentively.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was also a day full of the glaring sunlight. Upaka, who was a follower of Ajivika Religion, was in the middle of his journey of his ascetical training.<br>
When he passed near Gaya, he sensed something at the far way of the path and took a look over there. <br>
For a moment, he saw something illuminating the way over there like the sun.<br>
Upaka wonderingly approached it and he realized that it was a monk walking toward him.<br>
The monk's whole body was brightly illuminating more than anything else around it even in the bright sunlight.
