<p>
So the two of them took their children to Rajagaha, and by using a messenger they explained their situation to her parents.<br>
</p>
<p>
"My daughter, I cannot forgive the two of you. I will give some my of assets and ask you to leave the city as soon as possible.<br>
However, I will take care of your children, so bring them to my house."<br>
When they thought about their children's future, they cannot help but follow what their parents said.<br>
</p>
<p>
Thus, the two brothers started living with their grandfather and grandmother in Rajagaha.<br>
The grandfather and grandmother were devoted Buddhists.<br>
Chullapantaka was so young that the grandfather only took Mahapantaka to listen to the Buddha's teachings. <br>
Mahapantaka was so smart that he understood the teaching well and he started wishing to be a disciple of the Buddha.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Grandfather and Grandmother, if you allow me, I'd like to be a monk."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Of course, you can do so.<br>
We would be the happiest people in the world if you become a monk."<br>
</p>
<p>
Then the grandfather took him to the temple and left him in the Buddha's care.<br>
Being allowed to be a monk, Mahapantaka practiced hard as a Shramanera (student) reciting a lot of verses.<br>
Later he grew up to be an adult and officially became a monk and practiced harder. Soon by eliminating delusions, he became an Arhat.
