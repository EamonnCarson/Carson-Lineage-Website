<p>
In the mean time, the nuns would ask each of elder monks to give their sermons. <br>
</p>
<p>
One day, Chullapantaka got his turn. <br>
The nuns were talking about him.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Today's sermon will be boring because the elder Chullapantaka only know the verses, 'I sweep off the dust. I remove the dirt.'"<br>
"Well, why don't we recite these verses before the elder does?"<br>
Then Chullapantaka appeared.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Everybody, are you all practicing in harmony?"<br>
</p>
<p>
"Yes, we are training ourselves in harmony."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Now I'm going to recite important verses. Listen carefully."<br>
</p>
<p>
When he was about to recite, there were sounds of snickers. <br>
Some of them were trying to stifle their laughter. <br>
Chullapantaka heard the snickers and he used his divine power to float himself in the air.<br>
He was fading out in front of the nuns who were stunned with surprise.<br>
When they were stunned, he became visible again, and he emitted fire from his entire body.<br>
The nuns were speechless from witnessing this incredible scene.<br>
The atmosphere in which they were making fun of him was gone, and now they were gazing at him with awe.<br>
Then Chullapantaka finally started preaching.
