"Since the baby was born on the side of a path, let's name him Pantaka (path)."<br>

Several years later, she again became pregnant. <br>
After the similar conversation with the husband, she headed toward her parents' house, and on the way she again gave birth a baby body on a road.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Let's name the first child Mahapantaka (big path) and the second one Chullapantaka (small path)."<br>
</p>
<p>
The two boys grew up active and healthy and when they reached a certain age, they asked:<br>
"Mother, even though other kids have their grandfather and grandmother, why do we not have ones?"<br>
"Not around here but if you visit Rajagaha, you will meet your fabulously rich grandfather and grandmother."<br>

"If so, please take us there. We'd like to meet them soon."<br>
</p>
<p>
Then she was worried about how to cope with this, so she asked her husband.<br>
</p>

"I don't think my parents will kill us. How about taking the kids to their grandparents"<br>
"I cannot show myself to them, but I can take the kids around their house," said the husband.
