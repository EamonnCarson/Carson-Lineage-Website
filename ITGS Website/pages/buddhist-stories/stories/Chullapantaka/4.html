Mahapantaka went home and told the grandfather and grandmother:<br>
"The state of enlightenment is a very sacred and wonderful thing. I'd like to give this achievement to my brother.<br>
Please allow him to be a monk." <br>
</p>
<p>
Obtaining the grandfather's agreement, Chullapantaka also went to join to the Buddha.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was then eighteen years old.<br>
He was, however, a bit slow, and unlike his brother, he had a difficulty to learn.<br>
He could not memorize the verses that were given to him to memorize.<br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Like lotus flowers fragrantly blooming at sunrise,<br>
Let the Buddha's light shine on the world.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
When he barely memorized the first verse, he had forgotten the last one, and when he barely memorized the last one, he had already forgotten the first one. <br>
Even after four months, he could not recite it by himself.<br>
</p>
<p>
Though Mahapantaka expected something like this, he was disappointed indeed.<br>
"Chullapantaka, it looks like you are not able to be a monk. If you don't memorize one verse, how can you continue the much-harder practices of monks? <br>
You better give up and go home."<br>
