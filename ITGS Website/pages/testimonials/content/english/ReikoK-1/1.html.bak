It started happening right before this year's winter training.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
There was an audition of seeking back-up dancers for a black female singer named fLO, and I received a phone call from her business manager during the winter training, and was informed that they would like to have me as one of the four back-up dancers of fLO.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was extremely surprised by receiving this immediate baku-daiju.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Though the video shooting had been originally scheduled in the end of February,was advanced the date by a few weeks, and I also had to face a fact that other two of us were replaced just before the shooting. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I hardly can say that the shooting went smoothly, but we managed it somehow, and I was thinking what my next job will be?<br>
<!--replaced br-->
This kind of job differs from general clerical positions such as working Monday through Friday from 9am to 5pm, but we get every single job by taking auditions.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Therefore, we usually have 2nd or 3rd job including a dance instructor, or some other kinds of job, and whenever something comes up, we audition for that.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Shinnyo Soya-sama and Ryodoji-sama's baku-daiju gave me another great opportunity.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
The singer fLO directly asked me to involve in her 2nd single's back-up dancer without auditioning for that.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And a few weeks ago, she even gave me an offer to involve in her 3rd and 4th singles. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was happy with the offer itself and felt greatness of the baku-daiju, but there was even more opportunity to feel that greatness.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I didn't know who other three dancers were until I showed up to the first rehearsal, and they were all black females. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Please do not take this as racial discrimination; however, people normally want to line up with all black dancers on this occasion. It just looks better as a whole.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was talking to myself in my heart, "Are you serious? I cannot believe this is happening".<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I immediately realized that it was baku-daiju, and couldn't help being happy with that incredible moment. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
People who have been succeeded in something say unanimously that you can make your dream come true unless you don't give up. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I truly believe that hard work will be rewarded in all matters. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Unfortunately, however, some people may not be able to do things they want to, or need to abandon their likes for some reasons.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
In fact, an ancestor of <b>setback/breakdown/collapse/frustration/bafflement</b> was showed at sesshin. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I deeply feel that I've been such in a good environment where I am able to do things I want to.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I truly appreciate what others have done for me, and would like to be a foundation for others so that even one more person can be happy.<br>
