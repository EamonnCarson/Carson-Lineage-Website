 Hi, my name is Erika Graetz.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I was connected to the Shinnyo teaching in 2001 through my guiding mommy Manami-san we met through the Mother's Club Manami-san was organizing.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 At the time we were just moving to the Bay Area.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Before we moved to the Bay Area, we were living in a place called Orange County, CA where my husband was stationed there. (He was in the Marines.)<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 We just got married and had our first son. He was just 6 months old then.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When we moved to the US we had so many problems.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 First our language issue.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I was 19 and just finished high school, didn't know any better.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 So when I moved to the US I did not know how to be a mother, how to be a wife, how to be an adult.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 So many days I was crying and felt sorry for myself when I thought about what happened then about my son about my husband.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I was just a bad, irresponsible mom and wife and as a person, I am really sorry for what I have done to my son and my husband. I been so selfish.  <br>
 <br>
 Back then my husband had friends caused so many problems.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 He started to use very heavy drugs.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I did not know what he was doing or what the real drugs were like.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 So whenever his friends got together they were smoking something, had these bad people in our apartment, drinking and smoking,
 go out in the middle of the night.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 It was just a nightmare.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Once he had some person "wanted" (from other state police) in our house and stayed overnight.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 This person accused my husband for stealing his friend's drug.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Then he was hit in his face really badly.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Then we called police tell them what happened.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  At the same time I met first time with my parents-in-law.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I think something was helping us if I think of it now, that my son was alive, and me and my husband were alive.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
After that we decided to go to new York where my husband and his family were from.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
My husband stayed in CA because he needed it to look for work and to find the place we all could live.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 A few months later he found a place in San Mateo, CA.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 2nd son, we lived there for 6 years I never drove a car or anything that adult would do.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
So my husband did everything: dentist, doctor appointments, paying bills, etc.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Except for cooking and cleaning, taking care of our kids.<br>
