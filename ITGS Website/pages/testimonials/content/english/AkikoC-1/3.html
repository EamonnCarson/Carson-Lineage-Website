As I talked with my aunt a few times on the phone, I was able to guide her and her second son (my cousin) to the teaching. <br>
<br>
I was able to find a foster lineage parent in Japan and was told that both of them attended the Feast of Buddha’s Birth on April 8th.  <br>
<br>
When I told my mother about this, she told me surprisingly that she would ask my aunt about it, while normally she wouldn’t like hearing about Shinnyo-en, saying that her family religion is the Jodoshinshu sect of Buddhism. <br>
<br>
And another amazing thing happened. <br>
<br>
Under the kind guidance from my lineage parent and guiding parent, I was able to offer gohoshi on the Feast of Buddha’s Birth.  <br>
On the following night, I received a phone call from my sister-in-law who encouraged me to go to the temple and not worry about the twin nieces’ graduation because the religion is important. <br>
<br>
In addition, she told me that she would love to attend the new temple’s dedication service on May 18. <br>
<br>
To tell you the truth, when I attended the home meeting for the first time a few days ago, I mentioned that I didn’t know which one to choose between the Eza and graduation and received everyone’s advice.  <br>
<br>
Afterwards, I sent an e-mail to my brother-in-law, his wife (sister-in-law) and my mother-in-law, explaining what kind of bind I was in and asking them to choose the best one out of 3 options that I was thinking about. <br>
<br>
Those 3 options didn’t include anything that said I’d miss the graduation, go to the temple, and then on the 18th invite everyone to come to the dedication service.  <br>
<br>
But I’m so grateful that they decided that was the best option. <br>
<br>
Also the other day, when my husband called his mother, she gave him a message for me to go to the temple and not to worry about the graduation.<br>
 <br>
Because religion is so important, he was encouraged to go to the temple, too. <br>
<br>
I’ve learned so many things from this series of events. <br>
<br>
No matter what obstacles we may face, if we decide to practice the teaching and continue to make efforts without giving up, then the path will open up.  <br>
What we receive through the spiritual words may not make sense immediately but it will sooner or later.  <br>
<br>
Buddha, the Dharma Protectors, Shinnyo Parents and Ryodoji-sama are always watching over us.  <br>
<br>
Morning and evening chanting is important. And our ancestors render their support as well.  <br>
<br>
It truly gave me a great experience. <br>
<br>
I don’t know how much of it made sense to you, but I’d be happy if you could use this for some reference. <br>
