Having received the e-mail to gather testimonies from lineage members, I was thinking about it for a while. <br>
<br>
At the last home meeting, everyone shared about their precious experiences, and I was able to learn from them.  <br>
<br>
So, I thought maybe my talk could be useful for someone, too. <br>
<br>
That’s why I’m writing this testimony now.  <br>
<br>
There are so many elements involved, so I don’t know if I can explain everything well enough, but I’ll try my best in writing about them. <br>
<br>
First, it started from the e-mail I received in the beginning of March from my lineage parent and guiding parent about Daijo Eza. <br>
<br>
As soon as I saw the schedule, I thought to myself, “I can’t do it.” <br>
<br>
It was the same day as the high school graduation of our twin nieces.  <br>
<br>
We had already replied to the invitation in February that we would go. <br>
<br>
If it were the nieces on my side of the family, it may be a different story. <br>
<br>
But since they are my husband's nieces, it was difficult to push my opinion through.  <br>
<br>
My husband has only one sibling, an older brother.  <br>
<br>
But since there is a big age difference between them, his older brother takes good care of us as if he were our father. <br>
<br>
Their mother (my mother-in-law) had moved closer to her elder son’s home after her husband’s sudden passing 7 years ago on his travels.  <br>
<br>
Our family is small, but everyone gets along really well and enjoys getting together often. <br>
<br>
I replied to my lineage parent and guiding parent that I probably wouldn’t be able to attend Eza under such family circumstance. <br>
<br>
Afterwards, my guiding parent asked me if I could arrange the schedule somehow. <br>
<br>
I didn’t know what to do and just left at that.  <br>
<br>
About 2 weeks later, I had an opportunity to receive sesshin.  <br>
<br>
What was indicated first was a male ancestor on the paternal side who had an ailment that affected from abdominal area to the back. <br>
<br>
I first thought of my father who had died from stomach cancer. <br>
<br>
But I was told it wasn’t him.  I couldn’t figure out who this ancestor was.  <br>
<br>
Then, I remembered about an uncle who had passed way from colon cancer. <br>
<br>
He was my father’s elder brother.  I asked the medium if it was him, and the medium said yes.  <br>
<br>
I was told that this ancestor wanted to tell me something. <br>
<br>
But the medium didn’t tell me what it was exactly. <br>
<br>
But for some reason, I thought about his second son (my cousin) and also about his wife (my aunt). <br>
<br>
Latter part of the spiritual words concerned about myself, and there was also something that drew my attention. <br>
<br>
I was told that now is the time for me to build an unshakeable foundation. <br>
<br>
And the effort I make now would make a big difference in May. <br>
<br>
Immediately, I knew it was about the Daijo Eza.  <br>
<br>
But I only thought to myself, “Well then, I’m supposed to go to Eza” and didn’t do anything about it.  <br>
<br>
For the time being, I made an osegaki request for this uncle and went home. <br>
