My sesshin in December of the same year indicated:  "You may not have noticed, but Shinnyo Keishu-sama has provided a new path for you. Please attend next year's Winter Training every day." <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I tried to do as was said in the sesshin.  Shinnyo Keishu-sama told us during the Winter Training:  "Show your smile to the people around you." <br>
<!--replaced br-->
After I listened to her words, I was able to break through my old self and was able to make a fresh start.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
There was also a female ancestor on my husband's side who went to Australia to spread the Catholic faith.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
She is still seen in books, DVDs, and websites.  My husband is Catholic and I see her spiritual influence in my husband. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
That's why he keeps saying, "I am a Catholic, not a Shinnyo follower." <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It means that through my husband she was asking people to recognize her for what she had accomplished. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
My sesshin indicated that I should request a special Merit Transfer especially for her. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
This year is the 18th year since I have started to request special Merit Transfer for her.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And last August was her 100th year memorial so I requested a Grand Merit Transfer for her.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then, on February 19th of this year, I saw in the news: "Yahoo! News Story - Mother Mary MacKillop becomes first Australian saint." She was finally recognized.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
That was not the only help and support I have received from Shinnyo-en. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
From this experience and all of my other ones, I can better understand what Shojushin'in-sama told us about "the heart of inexhaustible loving compassion" and "the embracement and the power of creating spiritual harmony."<br>
<!--replaced br-->
With all of my ancestors, I offer my deep appreciation to the Buddha, the Shinnyo Parents, the Two Dojis, Shinnyo Keishu-sama, and the Guardians of the Law, and I will keep practicing to become a spiritual guide as soon as possible.<br>
