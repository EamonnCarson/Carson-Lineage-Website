I woke up one night when I had a dream about her daughter, telling me, “Thank you, Mika-chan.” <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Because I knew of her hospitalization, I asked my mother about her.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then, I found out that she passed away 1 week ago.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I saw her being well in my dreams later also.  

Last March, I visited my aunt and had a chance to talk with her about various things.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
She told me with a smile, “I never imagined that I’d send off my husband and even my daughter before me.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was glad to have Shinnyo-en’s faith. I know where my daughter is now. That fact makes me grateful.”  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
“I contemplate sometimes that I could have been a spiritual medium by now if I had continued endeavoring in the Teaching ever since you had invited me to go with you.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Because I’m elderly, I was endeavoring with my daughter with the wish that she would become a spiritual medium. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
But apparently I miscalculated.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
When my daughter was in the hospital, we promised that we’d go to Ogen’in together when she recovered.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I can’t go all the way to Tokyo by myself. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
But I wish to go there at least once.”  
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
She’s 83 year’s old this year and her back is bent.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It is hard for her now to return to Kyushu main temple.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
But at the end of this month, she is arranging to go to Ogen’in with her walking cane, together with my mother and her teaching friends.   <br>
