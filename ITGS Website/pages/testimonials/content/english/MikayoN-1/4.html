During this year's Winter Training, she did the reading gohoshi of Path of Oneness.<br>  
<!--replaced br-->
She practiced reading at home, in order not to make mistakes when many people are reading along.<br>  
<!--replaced br-->
Out of the whole section she was appointed to read, she divided it into smaller sections to practice each day.  <br>
<!--replaced br-->
But every time she started to practice, she was interrupted by the phone calls or a visitor at the door. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then, she would start over from the beginning.  <br>
She had to repeat that many times, but because of that, she was grateful to able to read it perfectly during the Winter Training. <br>
<!--replaced br--> 
I told her, "Thank you, aunty. 
<!--replaced br-->I'm not sure whether or not I'll be able to live as long as you have and keep the feeling of appreciation as you do.
<!--replaced br-->I'm so glad to have come to see you." <br> 
<!--replaced br-->
She laughed and said, "Even I can still be of some use?"<br>
<!--replaced br-->
She is taking up the role of a mother for her grandchild in place of her daughter and doing her best to pass on the Teaching to her grandchild. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Iâ€™ll do my best, too.  Thank you very much.<br>
