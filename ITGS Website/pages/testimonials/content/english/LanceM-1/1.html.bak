My name is Lance Murray, Morita lineage, Mie 3 division.<br>

There are a lot of people I recognize today, but there are also a lot of new faces to me.<br>

So, it may surprise some of the newer followers to know that I have been practicing Shinnyo-En at this temple for over 10 years.<br>

I have given my proof here twice already, and I donâ€™t want to go over old ground to those who have already heard about my life before The Teaching, but instead I would like to share with you the past 
4 years of my practice.<br>



In my 10 years at Shinnyo-En I have been blessed in many ways, but like many gifts that we receive in our life, we only truly appreciate them after they are lost.<br>

I received a lot of mercy from Sooya-sama. <br>

I was able to attend a lot of special services, in the USA, Europe, and in Japan.<br>

Some of these services I was actually able to participate in the ceremonies.<br>

Several months before the L.A. Saito Homa, my sesshin indicated "if you veer off the path, you will get pulled into deep mud that will be very difficult to escape from."<br>



Less than 2 years after performing Saito Homa in Japan, I was seriously considering suicide.<br>

Yes, I had slid so far into the Lower Realms that even I did not feel that there was an escape.<br>

I though death was the only way to end my suffering.<br>

This was not just a one time though, but I seriously considered and planned it about 6 times.<br>

The world of my karma looked like a brighter, more desirable place.<br>
 
It seemed like the right path for me to take.<br>

I had an affair, started gambling, and was becoming an alcoholic.<br>

I borrowed money from my retirement accounts, from my savings, and built a large credit card debt.<br>

Karma is a terrible thing.<br>
