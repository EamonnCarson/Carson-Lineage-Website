I always felt that things I got I "earned" somehow. <br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I did not appreciate that it was given to me by Soya-sama.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I felt it was my ability, and not something from the Shinnyo Spiritual world. <br>
<!-- replaced br-->
It was not a reward, but instead as a method to help me realize what I was lacking.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I took things self-centered and human-centered.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
<!-- replaced br-->
<!-- replaced br-->
But, I had two lifelines that saved me.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
The first was my children. <br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I cried more in those 3 years than in my whole life.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
It was almost a daily ritual where I was "stuck in the mud of depression."<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
My children allowed me to breathe, and feel like a real person at times.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
At other times I realized the damage I had caused to them, and realized this would affect their whole lives. <br>
<!-- replaced br-->
<!-- replaced br-->
<!-- replaced br-->
My second lifeline came from an unusual source, yet it should not have been unexpected.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
At the LA Saito Homa I took care of my children in the kids' room while my ex-wife and her mother attended the service.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I was afraid to see Shinnyo Keishu-sama.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
I felt dirty, and I knew I had been a big disappointment to her.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
But, she came to the kids' room following the services to wave to everyone.<br>
<!-- replaced br--> 
Even though I watched her face with tears in my eyes, she did not look at me.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
Suddenly, right before she left, she looked into my eyes for about 15 seconds.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
She poured her warmth and compassion into my heart.<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
She was telling me "it is okay."<br>
<!-- replaced br-->
The tears were running down my face at this compassion, it was not what I expected, but what I should have expected.<br>
