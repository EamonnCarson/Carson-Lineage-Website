For more than 10 years my lineage parent had kept telling me, "It's important to have exercise in a gym for your body. You better go." <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I only replied with "Yes" and never went.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Finally I stared going to a gym last year December 2008. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
When three months had passed since I started exercising in the gym, my fitness coach asked me to write my proof. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I asked him back, "Proof?"<br>
<!--replaced br-->
For me, the word "proof" meant "testimonial proof" frequently used in Shinnyo-en.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
He repeatedly asked me, "The results of your exercises have improved in the last few months since you joined the gym.
Why don't you write about the improvement?"<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I agreed. Then I remembered the spiritual words from a sesshin I received last December: <br>
<!--replaced br-->
<i>"The words from the Buddha resides in the non Shinnyo-en followers, too." </i><br>
<!--replaced br-->
<i>"Please realize with your prayer that any incident in every day life which you think has nothing to do with Shinnyo-en is an indication of the words from the Buddha." </i><br>
<!--replaced br-->
A few days later, I received different spiritual words: <br>
<!--replaced br-->
<i>"Please show your proof to many people. You don't need to decorate it with fancy words." </i> <br>
<!--replaced br-->
<i>"You simply tell them about the 'ever-present' of Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama." </i><br>
<!--replaced br-->
Soon after that, I started re-reading all the proofs provided by the people in our lineage, and that encouraged me for writing my proof.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Therefore, the following is actually a letter to my fitness coach.<br>
<!--replaced br-->  
Thank you in advance for reading this:
