 My fight with my karma continued.<br>
<br>
 At the founder's birthday celebration in the 50th year of the Teaching, I returned to the Oyasono and was able to meet Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama for the first time.<br>
<br>
 Kyoshu-sama told me, "When you're sad or in suffering, chant Namu Shinnyo Ichinyo Daihatsu Nehankyo, okay? The Buddha is always there with you, do you understand? You understand, right?" It was like I was seeing a dream.<br>
<br>
 A month and a half later I returned home to find my husband had moved out to be with his girlfriend and the three children who were still small were living on their own.<br>
<br>
 I was taken aback.<br>
<br>
 I was filled with a pain like my heart had been gouged out by a sharp knife.<br>
<br>
 When I finally received sesshin on it, there was an indication of a bad marriage and never attaining happiness.<br>
<br>
 I thought this wasn't supposed to happen, whenever I was by myself and opened the Path of Oneness, it was always on the page of establishing the Shinnyo spiritual world where Shojushinin-sama is sending Kyodoin-sama to the spiritual world.<br>
<br>
 I understood in theory, but was beginning to feel like if I have to go through so much, I'd rather die.<br>
<br>
 When I went to seek advice, I was in turn asked this question: "What will happen to the children?" I felt sorry for being so selfish and desperately called out the Shinnyo parents' names.<br>
<br>
 That year, I was able to receive elevation of Daijo.<br>
<br>
 I didn't want my children to carry on my karma, so I practiced wholeheartedly.<br>
<br>
 Suddenly, my husband came asking for a divorce.<br>
<br>
 Difficult times followed, especially since I had a hard time with endurance.<br>
<br>
 I worked really hard with hardly any time to sleep.<br>
<br>
 Three years had passed, and I was given an opportunity to receive direct guidance from Shinnyo Keishu-sama.<br>
<br>
 I talked about my family matters.<br>
<br>
 She told me, everything will be fine.<br>
<br>
 True to her words, my husband had unexpectedly changed his attitude and the divorce was finalized in the best possible situation.<br>
<br>
 Wishing to treasure my husband's feeling, I recalled my sesshin and with deep gratitude to the Shinnyo spiritual world, I was able to sign the divorce papers.<br>
<br>
 At the Kangi Hon-eza, I received the spiritual words, "Just as you have been through so much suffering, Ryodoji-sama in the spiritual world have been through that much working to give you bakku-daiju.<br>
<br>
 They made it possible for you to practice with ease.<br>
<br>
" Filled with gratitude and remorse, I received elevation of Kangi.<br>
<br>
 Then my karma returned, trying to keep me from happiness.<br>
<br>
 This time it came at my health.<br>
<br>
 A tumor was found in my uterus and I immediately had to have surgery.<br>
<br>
 If I had the surgery even a few days later, my uterus would have burst and I wouldn't have been alive.<br>
<br>
 At about the same time, I had a heart attack.<br>
<br>
 In my sesshin, a woman who passed away with stomach related illness and my grandmother's brother who passed away young with tuberculosis were indicated.<br>
<br>
 I realized the importance of acknowledging the ancestors.<br>
