 She would come to my house once every week and talk to me about the teaching.<br>
<br>
 Now she dyes her hair black, but I believe I'm responsible for more than half of her gray hairs.<br>
<br>
 I feel terribly sorry for having caused her so much worries.<br>
<br>
 One day, I had a dream of a boy wearing a school uniform.<br>
<br>
 I later found out it was Shindoin-sama.<br>
<br>
 At the Dedication ceremony of the San Francisco temple, Shinnyo Keishu-sama mentioned, "Even if you physical eyes are open, if your eyes of the heart are sleeping, you wouldn't be able to see the truth."<br>
<br>
Hearing those words, I was able to open my heart little by little.<br>
<br>
 Fighting my karma, it had taken me a year to be able to receive sesshin.<br>
<br>
 In my first sesshin, I received the sono-uta, "Encountering the last teaching of the Buddha is like finally finding one's long-last compassionate mother.<br>
<br>
" The father of my soul is Kyoshu-sama and Shojushinin-sama is my mother.<br>
<br>
 I was so happy for the first time in my life that I cried.<br>
<br>
 Principal Sawada was also indicated and I felt really sorry.<br>
<br>
 Even though it was little by little, I felt something hard like an ice was melting away.<br>
<br>
 I used to take advantage of others, thinking that people should be doing things for me.<br>
<br>
 But through the Shinnyo teaching, I was taught to have gratitude.<br>
<br>
 It was my feeling towards my stepfather that made me suffer for so long.<br>
<br>
 Due to the bakku-daiju of Ryodoji-sama, I was able to learn that it was harder to be held a grudge against rather than holding it.<br>
<br>
 One day in a sesshin it was indicated, "Do you want to know why you had to be born in such a way? It was the Buddha's great compassion you were given this trial.<br>
<br>
 There are many people in this world who are in suffering seeking for happiness.<br>
<br>
 You have the mission to transmit this teaching to those people.<br>
<br>
 You can overcome any hardships because you have the teaching.<br>
<br>
 It was a test given to you, to wake you up because the Buddha is counting on you.<br>
<br>
" I had always shed tears of suffering but never thought I would be shedding tears of joy.<br>
<br>
 I felt glad to be alive and that I had found what I had been searching but never thought I would be shedding tears of joy.<br>
<br>
 I felt glad to be alive and that I had found what I had been searching for  all along.<br>
<br>
 I couldn't help but put my hands together in Gassho.<br>
