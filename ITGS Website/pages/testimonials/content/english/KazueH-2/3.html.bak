 My fight with my karma continued.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 At the founder's birthday celebration in the 50th year of the Teaching, I returned to the Oyasono and was able to meet Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama for the first time.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Kyoshu-sama told me, "When you're sad or in suffering, chant Namu Shinnyo Ichinyo Daihatsu Nehankyo, okay? The Buddha is always there with you, do you understand? You understand, right?" It was like I was seeing a dream.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 A month and a half later I returned home to find my husband had moved out to be with his girlfriend and the three children who were still small were living on their own.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I was taken aback.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I was filled with a pain like my heart had been gouged out by a sharp knife.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I finally received sesshin on it, there was an indication of a bad marriage and never attaining happiness.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I thought this wasn't supposed to happen, whenever I was by myself and opened the Path of Oneness, it was always on the page of establishing the Shinnyo spiritual world where Shojushinin-sama is sending Kyodoin-sama to the spiritual world.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I understood in theory, but was beginning to feel like if I have to go through so much, I'd rather die.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I went to seek advice, I was in turn asked this question: "What will happen to the children?" I felt sorry for being so selfish and desperately called out the Shinnyo parents' names.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 That year, I was able to receive elevation of Daijo.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I didn't want my children to carry on my karma, so I practiced wholeheartedly.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Suddenly, my husband came asking for a divorce.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Difficult times followed, especially since I had a hard time with endurance.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I worked really hard with hardly any time to sleep.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Three years had passed, and I was given an opportunity to receive direct guidance from Shinnyo Keishu-sama.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I talked about my family matters.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 She told me, everything will be fine.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 True to her words, my husband had unexpectedly changed his attitude and the divorce was finalized in the best possible situation.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Wishing to treasure my husband's feeling, I recalled my sesshin and with deep gratitude to the Shinnyo spiritual world, I was able to sign the divorce papers.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 At the Kangi Hon-eza, I received the spiritual words, "Just as you have been through so much suffering, Ryodoji-sama in the spiritual world have been through that much working to give you bakku-daiju.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 They made it possible for you to practice with ease.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
" Filled with gratitude and remorse, I received elevation of Kangi.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Then my karma returned, trying to keep me from happiness.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 This time it came at my health.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 A tumor was found in my uterus and I immediately had to have surgery.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 If I had the surgery even a few days later, my uterus would have burst and I wouldn't have been alive.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 At about the same time, I had a heart attack.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 In my sesshin, a woman who passed away with stomach related illness and my grandmother's brother who passed away young with tuberculosis were indicated.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I realized the importance of acknowledging the ancestors.<br>
