I am filled with gratitude for having been born as a human and having encountered the Buddha.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Today, I have been given a chance to open my heart and share my proof with you.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 For that I would like to offer my gratitude to Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama, Shojushinin-sama, Kyodoin-sama, Shindoin-sama, Shinnyo Keishu-sama and the Guardians of the Law.<br>

<!-- replaced br -->
I was born between a Japanese mother and an American father a year after the World War II ended.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Thinking about my future, my grandfather registered me as his fourth daughter to city hall.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 He named me Kazue with the meaning of wishing me to have at least one blessing.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I was of the age to start elementary school, I was denied admission because of my skin color.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 My step-father, who used to be a newspaper reporter, learned of an institution for children with mixed blood called the Elizabeth Sanders Home in Kanagawa prefecture, and decided to put me there.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Not knowing anything, I was taken there and had to live a group life for fourteen years.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 There was a big gate, and inside it was a church and Saint Stephano Elementary school.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Then there was a tunnel to the other side of the mountain, where the Elizabeth Sanders Home was.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Yearning for my mother, I would often stare at the tunnel and cry.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I learned that nobody was coming for me, my feelings toward my stepfather turned to hate and grudge.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I told myself, as long as I live, I would never forgive him.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 At the time, that seemed to be all I thought about.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Principle Sawada was very devout Christian and all the children received baptism.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When we would go out to town, people would look at us as dirt and throw rocks at us or spit as us.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I can only remember negative things and bore a grudge against my destiny.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Even though we went to church, I wouldn't open my heart to anyone, especially toward principal Sawada, to whom I couldn't open my heart.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I was sixteen, I was able to see my mother again but I had lost any humanly feelings so whenever I saw someone sad or in need of help, I would laugh at them saying, "Serves you right."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When I started going out with people, they would find out about the Sanders home and it would always haunt me and follow me like a shadow.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 However I, too, was given a chance to get married.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 I married a soldier from the Yokota base.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Both of us grew up in a similar environment of not knowing our family.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Eventually, my husband took to drinking, gambling, extra-marital affairs.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 For that I cursed at my life, despite being blessed with three children.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Since my husband was in the military, we never stayed in one place, always moving from place to place.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 We arrived in California in September of 1980.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 A friend introduced me to my present lineage parent.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 But back then, I couldn't trust anyone, no matter what was said to me, I just couldn't open my heart.<br>
