After a couple of years of putting up with me, my husband finally was fed up and came back to the United States, hoping that I would follow him soon after.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
But that was not the case, I stayed in Japan for two more years, acting like I was single again, when one phone call from my husband came, telling me, "he was tired of waiting, and that I had to make a decision of whether I wanted to stay in Japan, which meant a divorce, or come back now and try to work things out."<br>

Before we hung up the phone I asked him to give me one more month, to make a decision that would affect the rest of my life.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
During this time of making my decision I did not know, that the remains of Founder Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama, Shojushin'in-sama, Shindoin-sama, and Kyodoin-sama were at the Main temple of Oyasono, TOGETHER for the first time.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When the family members of Founder Kyoshu-sama, passed away they were not all buried together.<br>

After, 65 years in 2001 were they finally brought back together to be placed in the Stupas on the grounds of Oyasono.<br>

How I found out about this wonderful occasion was, one day a student of mine came waltzing into my class and sat down in front of me wearing a "Rimbo," a wheel shaped symbol of Buddhism around her neck.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
A Rimbo with a lotus flower in its center is the symbol of Shinnyo-en.<br>

I asked this follower if she was a follower of Shinnyo-en, and she was surprised responding, "how do you know, about Shinnyo-en?"  I told her I was once a practicing follower, 5 or 6 years ago.<br>

After our conversation, that afternoon we had lunch a few times and we had truthful conversations of why I hesitated to go back to the temple or Oyasono.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Oyasono was so close by yet so far.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I drove passed the temple everyday practically, I rode the same trains as the followers did every day.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I even worked in the same city just on the other side of the train station from Oyasono, but still took that all for granted.<br>
