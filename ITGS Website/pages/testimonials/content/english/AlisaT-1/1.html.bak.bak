Good evening, my name is Alisa Torres, from the Dickey Lineage, 2nd North California District.<br>
<br>
Tonight, I would like to share with you about how I was able to change my Karma through this teaching.<br>
<br>
What is "Karma?"  Karma refers to the principle of cause and effect.<br>
<br>
But before I begin,  I would like to give my utmost gratitude to the Guardians of the Law, who protect the Buddha's teachings, my Spiritual parents-Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama, Shoju-shin'in-sama, their sons Kyodoin and Shindoin-sama who carry my burden through the power of what we followers call "Bakku-Daiju," Shinnyo Keishu-sama, who heads the order today, and to the Ever-Present Shyakamuni-Tathagata, to give me this wonderful opportunity to share with you my testimony tonight.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me begin with, when I was connected to this teaching over 20 years ago, YES, some of you may be surprised of how long I have been connected.<br>
<br>
I was connected to Shinnyo-en through family connection. This means someone introduced my father to the Shinnyo teaching.<br>
<br>
The word "Shinnyo" can mean "unchanging truth" or "the real state of things". <br>
<br>
Funny how time flies, because I didn't really start to practice or should I say see the "REAL STATE OF THINGS," until 10 years ago.<br>
<br>
With no disrespect to my parents today, when my father was connected, the "<i>REAL STATE OF THINGS</i>," was that my parents were separated for reasons I did not know at the time.<br>
<br>
Even though my father, along with my siblings were connected, we did not practice.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until 3 years later after my parents separation, we got the phone call from my father's lineage parent  that prompted us to begin practicing.<br>
<br>
My parents began the next process of getting a divorce when we began to practice here in Seattle with a hand full of followers, or course me being the youngest.<br>
<br>
I'm going to fast forward a little, after practicing here in Seattle for 2 years, my father was stationed or you could say assigned to a military base in Japan.<br>
<br>
  When we got to Japan, my father practiced very hard at Oyasono, the main temple, under the Founder Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama.<br>
<br>
  Each time I think of this, I am saddened that the opportunity to practice with Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama passed right by me, because after we moved to Japan, I chose a very different path, you could say, I chose a very selfish path.<br>
<br>
