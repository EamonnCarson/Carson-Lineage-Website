Representing all the followers of Shinnyo-en U.S.A., I, Kazue Hayes, would like to humbly offer these Words of Gratitude.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Since the day I encountered the Shinnyo teaching, I have received innumerable blessings.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I used to pity myself believing that I was the most unfortunate person in the world. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I held a grudge against society and could not place any trust in any people. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Despite the fact that I sued to be this kind of person, I was able to find the answer that I had been searching for in the Shinnyo Teaching which has the Mahaparinirvana Sutra as its canon. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
My feeling toward the Teaching is well expressed by a sono-uta, which reads:<br>
<!-- replaced br -->

        "Encountering the last teaching of the Buddha is like finally finding one's long-lost compassionate mother.""

<!-- replaced br -->
<!-- replaced br -->
Upon finding the Teaching, I was able to shed tears of gratitude instead of tears of sorrow.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
At the beginning, the more I made efforts in practicing the Teaching in order to become happier, the more I became perplexed and confused. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I expected that I would find happiness in my family life. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
However, my family became dissolved. "This could not have happened." With these feelings, I would open the Path of Oneness. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Whenever I did so with prayer in my heart, I found it strange that I constantly opened to the same page. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
There, I found how Shojushinin-sama felt when she had to see Kyodoin-sama passing away in order to establish the Shinnyo spiritual world. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When I contemplated on her sorrowful experience, I realized that I was so fortunate to have my children. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I became determined to nurture and guide them so that they would become youths who protect the Teaching. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I was told many times through spiritual words, "Shojushinin-sama is always with you!" Whenever I was almost daunted, I offered prayers to Shojushinin-sama asking, "How shall I be able to overcome this?" She always appeared in my dreams to encourage me or to admonish me.<br>
