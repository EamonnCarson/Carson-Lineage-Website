I used to blame someone else whenever I have a problem.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Whenever I had a hard time, I accused my husband like, "My life shouldn't be like that!"<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
But, my feelings toward him turned into gratitude, "Thank you for marrying such a selfish person like me!"<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
It was my most joyful moment because before that, I felt the Shinnyo Parents didn't care about me anymore.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
In the next year, I was elevated to the 'daikangi' spiritual level.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
If I hadn't had the Shinnyo Teaching, I would have gone back to Japan with my kids and I would have become a burden on my parents.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
The Shinnyo Parents are ever present. Thus, there is nothing I can't overcome.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I can overcome anything. By fully realizing it, I became more confident in myself about living in America.<br>

As if he had followed me, my husband was also elevated to the 'kangi' spiritual level.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Since he was a truck driver, he was given the opportunity to a new job at Consulate-General of Japan in San Francisco, which gave him a relief physically and financially.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Before working for Consulate-General of Japan, he also started with a job that he didn't want to do.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I understand that when you start dealing with a thing you don't like, you will see the way out.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
He often said to the people around him, "If I think of how I would be without the Shinnyo Teaching, I can't help myself talking about the Shinnyo Teaching to anybody (otasuke)."<br>  
<!-- replaced br -->
He was also given a role as a lineage chief for Cleaning Gohoshi.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
My husband and I offer "kangi" as much as we can on a monthly basis.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Now, the more we practice the "three practices," the better we realize the importance of the "three practices."<br>
