Go ahead and take a rest,<br>
But continue on life's big test.<br>

When you feel like dropping down,<br>
You want to smile, but instead you frown.<br>
Like the water has all dried up,<br>
Just continue on and fill the cup.<br>

When the fog blocks the sun to brighten your day,<br>
Just think positive and clear it away.<br>
Try your best and be proud of what you've done,<br> 
Because the hardships will be over as soon as they've begun.<br>

Look at criticism as advice,<br>
Then your happiness will suffice.<br>
Continue on and learn from your mistakes,<br> 
Then the mirror to be your true self won't be opaque.<br>

Believe, learn, work, and try,<br>
Don't let your perseverance wear out and die.<br>
Next time your hopes and dreams are gone,<br> 
Remember don't give up and continue on.<br>
