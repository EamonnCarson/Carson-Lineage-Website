I thought I learned English well in Japan, but I didn't have a good command of it at all.<br>
<br>  
This was another shock for me.<br>
<br>  
Even then, when I truly decided to exert myself, I felt that Ryodoji-sama extended their compassionate support and I was able to pass the important exams.<br>
<br>   
My children were very patient as well.<br>
<br>  
Gradually, my heart started to open up, but even then, I couldn't bring myself up to expressing verbally what I had in mind.<br>
<br>  
When I tried to say something, I heard my own voice inside, saying, "People will laugh at me if I said something like that," or "I'll get ridiculed if someone like me who is a total country bumpkin said that," and as a result, I couldn't say anything.<br>
<br>  
No matter how much affection I felt toward my children, I couldn't even tell them, "I love you" if someone else was around me."<br>
<br>  
If people said to me, "You must really adore your kids," I would reply, "No, not so much," or "I don't really feel it yet.<br>
<br>  
In reality, I wished I could answer straight, saying, "Yes, very much so," but what came out of my mouth was completely opposite.<br>
<br>  
I always felt it to be so painful as if it were piercing my heart.<br>
<br>  
Unlike me, my sister-in-law and mother-in-law openly express their affections toward children in words and in attitude and raise the children so lovingly.<br>
<br>  
I wondered when I would be able to behave like them.<br>
<br>  
I wanted to break through my tendency of protecting my self-ego.<br>
<br>  
I increasingly became so frustrated with myself.<br>
<br>  
When I saw no one around, I was able to express my honest feeling very quietly.<br>
<br>  
But I was fed up with myself always acting so secretively.<br>
<br>  
Once I sought guidance from the seniors in the teaching (jogubodai) about this.<br>
<br>  
And I learned that the area where I grew up had a strong connection with those who practiced Christian faith in hiding to avoid persecution.<br>
<br>  
I realized that my thoughts and feelings are closely related to that of people who could only pursue their faith in secret.<br>
<br>  
In any case, I made an effort to say what I wanted to say, gathering up the courage to speak explicitly.<br>
<br>   
Although it took me a long time, I am now able to talk to my children straight from my heart.<br>
<br>  
I feel as though Shojushin'in-sama has given me a light push on my back to step forward.<br>
<br> 
<br>
Last summer, my mother came to visit here and stayed with me for a while.<br>
<br>  
We had a lot to talk about.<br>
<br>  
One day, we had a conversation about the time when I was small.<br>
<br>  
She was in tears and apologized to me, saying, "I was a terrible mother for you children.<br>
<br>  
I'm so sorry."<br>
<br>  
Perhaps because I had been nurtured in the Teaching since I was very young, I knew that she did her best trying her ways to be a good mother, giving us the disciplines in the best way she knew how.<br>
<br>  
Normally, someone in my position might have held a grudge or bitter feeling towards a mother, but in my mind, I never once felt that way.<br>
<br>  
When I saw her crying when sharing the past memories, I thought that she must have gone through so much agony, and realized that I was about to do the same thing toward my children.<br>
<br>  
I'm filled with gratitude for this opportunity I had.<br>
<br>  
My parents are the one and only for me, and I love them with all my heart.<br>
<br>
