My husband, who had wished to live in America, and I (together with our two kids) moved to the Bay Area from Tokyo in 2004.<br>
<br>
Before we came to America, my husband and I discussed about our moving, and I was against it in the beginning.<br>
<br>
I thought like, "Can he get a job there?" "Is it possible for me to live there even though I don't speak English?" I was worried.<br>
<br>
Later, I changed my mind and said, "Let's live in the U.S." Now he was against it. "No, let's drop it," he said. We never agreed each other.<br>
<br>
After my sesshin indicated, "It looks like you are going to start living in America," my worries were gone, and we started preparing for our moving to the U.S.<br>
<br>
The first thing we had to do before actually moving to America was save money because my foster lineage parent, who lived in the U.S., advised me, "Before coming to America, you better save money first."<br>
<br>
However, I used to spend as much as I had, so I didn't know how to save money.<br>
<br>
When I was wondering about saving money, my parents told me, "Stay with us since you are busy with your two kids."<br>
<br>
My husband and I started living with my parents and started saving money little by little, but I hadn't told them about our plan to move to the U.S. yet.<br>
<br>
I received my greencard two months later. It was due to the power from the spiritual world.<br>
<br>
When I told my parents about our moving to the U.S., they opposed it.<br>
<br>
They said that they wanted my husband to succeed their business, and they told me to convince him to do so.<br>
<br>
My parents had been helping us financially, so I didn't want to let them down. But I also wanted to follow the spiritual words from my sesshin.<br>
<br>
I thought if we stayed with my parents, however, we would have kept depending on them. I decided to try our best in America so that we won't be the burden on them anymore.<br>
<br>
It was my first time when I saw my father's tears. "After all, it's your decision," he said.<br>
