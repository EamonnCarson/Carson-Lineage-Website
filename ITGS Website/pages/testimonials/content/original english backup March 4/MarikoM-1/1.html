Dear Shinnyo Keishu sama,<br>
<br>
<br>
Today, I attended a home-meeting.  To tell the truth, however, I was reluctant to attend because I didn't feel well and felt tired.<br>
<br>
Especially in the past few months, I had been busy in work and had been feeling down.<br>
<br>
But, as I listened to the people at the home-meeting, I felt ashamed myself for lack of my efforts, and at the same time their kindness and warmheartedness touched my heart and I cried for joy.<br>
<br>
I realized how much they cared about my husband and me, and they listened to me patiently. They gave me a lot of advice, and my words cannot describe my gratitude. I was really grateful.<br>
<br>
If I hadn't been connected to Shinnyo-en, I wouldn't have had such a precious feeling.<br>
<br>
Hadn't been connected to Shinnyo-en, my husband and I would stay at each separate room, would be just facing the each computer monitor alone, and would spend lonely time.  I really appreciate being a Shinnyo follower.<br>
<br>
From now on, I'd like to try hard for providing what they have done for me to other people.<br>
<br>
Since I'm not used to inviting people to my house, it would be challenging, but it would also be my effort I have to tackle.<br>
<br>
There are some people in my husband's office who are interested in the Shinnyo Teaching, but they hesitate to come to the Temple.<br>
<br>
So, inviting those people to my house would especially be a good idea.<br>
<br>
I will do my best.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, Shinnyo Keishu sama.<br>
