I forgot to bring my Eza Card with me for the Daijo Eza on 09/27/2009. (So I couldn't attend the Eza.)<br>
<br>
If I hadn't talked with my Linage Parent at that time, I would have simply gone home.<br>
<br>
By talking with her, however, I realized that it was not just forgetting the Eza Card, but it was something very important.<br>
<br>
I was wrong at the very basic.<br>
<br>
It was my mistake that I stored my Eza Card in a box because I thought it was something precious.<br>
<br>
I should have been carrying something like that all the time.<br>
<br>
Not only the Eza Card, but also I should have been carrying the Shinnyo Teaching with me all the time.<br>
<br>
I treated it like a displayed art work, so I didn't carry it.<br>
<br>
I should have always carried the Shinnyo Teaching with me, like a stationery good, and I should have been ready for using it anytime.<br>
<br>
It looks like there was a wall or some kind of armor around my heart and mind.
So my mind only took the Shinnyo Teching as information, but I saw it as something in another world.<br>
<br>
That's why I have been unable to take one step forward for a long time.<br>
<br>
Even if I did, it was not with "Oneness with Shinnyo."<br>
<br>
Because I had the wrong basics, I couldn't have reached where I should have.<br>
<br>
Although I was so disappointed for not attending the Eza, I was glad that I was given an opportunity to mediate alone in the training room.<br>
<br>
Without my failure for attending the Eza and without the kindness of the Office staff, I wouldn't have realized this very important thing.<br>
<br>
I was fortunate enough to realized it before too late.<br>
<br>
Even though I have a long way to go, I will do my best for becoming someone dependable. I appreciate your support.<br>
<br>
I was shocked about not bringing the Eza Card, but I have also gained something very important.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much,<br>
<br>
Akiko<br>
