Although some people in the past, like my PE teachers, my volleyball coach, and the doctors in the hospitals told me to "bend your right knee like that" and to "move your body and legs in that way, then stand up like this," I had been unable to do in the way they expected.<br>
<br>
Or I was like, "I know I cannot do those, so why bother?"<br>
<br>
<br>
But now I become a person who "can do it" each time I try.<br>
<br>
This is the power of bakku-daiju I've been given.<br>
<br>
Through your exercise instruction, the power from Shinnyo-en is working on my body.<br>
<br>
Thus, I can easily move and I can almost sit my on legs folded under.<br>
<br>
So it is getting easier to live in everyday life.<br>
<br>
The reason why I feel in that way is that I see my body is now different from it used to be and the progress of my body improvement.<br>
<br>
My family and I are happy about that.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

In 1982, I received a consultative sesshin and the spiritual words indicated as such:<br>
<br>
<i>"The Buddha won't tell you if your leg can be fully treated or not because He is not a fortune teller."<br>
<br>
"You are not just asking the Buddha for a favor, but also asking Him impossible." <br>
<br>
"It is like to create a thing from nothing."<br>
<br>
"But, when you practice in oneness with the Shinnyo teaching,  your soul will be saved."<br>
<br>
"Then, even if your leg isn't fully treated, it won't bother you any more."<br>
<br>
"It is your karma."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
The spiritual words also indicated:<br>
<br>
<i>"When your uncle (your father's brother) was 24 years old, he had lost his leg by a bomb during a war while he was sent as a messenger from one  unit to another."<br>
<br>
"And you have a unknown female ancestor in your mother's side a way back  in the past, who had walked with a limp and suffered like 'Why my life is like this?'"<br>
<br>
"Even after her death, she is still suffering in the spiritual world."<br>
<br>
"Please don't forget that those two spirits will be saved by Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama as you constantly make the spiritual consolation requests for them."<br>
<br>
"Also, please remember you always have "bakku-daiju" from Ryodoji-sama."<br>
<br>
"Depending on your spiritual training, you may be able to increase the walking distance without getting tired like 100 meters this time then 200 meters next time with the help of bakku-daiju."</i><br>
<br>
<br>
After that, whenever I made spiritual consolation requests as the spiritual words suggested, I felt warm on my right heel.<br>
<br>
At first, I thought that warm feeling was just in my head.<br>
<br>
Since the Winter of that year, however, I have never had the frostbite on my feet from the tiptoes to the ankles.<br>
<br>
The more I was elevated in the spiritual ranks, the less I  concerned about my leg.<br>
<br>
I wrote this letter to my coach Dr. Daniel Villeda in April 2009.  It is August now and as the follow-up, I will write about how much I am getting healthier under the exercise training with him.<br>
<br>
I'd like to convey my gratitude towards the Buddha, the Shinnyo  Parents, Ryodoji-sama, Shinnyo Keishu-sama, the Guardians of the Law, my ancestors, and the people around me.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for reading.<br>
