I'm writing about what I realized through my children and my tendencies that I have accumulated since my birth:<br>
<br>
<br>
Both of my parents have been working full-time since I was a child.<br>
<br>  
Due to that circumstance, my grandparents who lived next door and my aunt were the ones who usually looked after me.<br>
<br>  
However, because my grandparents ran a liquor store and were very busy, we didn't have very much time to talk.<br>
<br>  
I grew up in a rural area where it was a common place to look for other people's faults or weaknesses, rather than to give complimentary remarks to others, share in their joys or sorrows.<br>
<br>  
I remember that I used to play with my father often on his days off.<br>
<br>  
But as for my mother, all I remember is the times when she bought me nice clothes, which would make my friends feel envious.<br>
<br>  
I was always conscious about how others might look at me.<br>
<br>  
In everyday life, I was always negative and pessimistic about the way I thought or reacted to what I heard.<br>
<br>  
Now when I think of it, it amazes me that someone like myself was able to come to America, so far away from home.<br>
<br>  
When my mother's younger sister came back to visit from the US from time to time, I used to yearn to be like her because she looked like she was always full of joy.<br>
<br>  
Since my home town is in the countryside, my aunt, with her hair dyed in red, stood out very much.<br>
<br>  
I used to wonder what America was like.<br>
<br>  
I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would live here as I do now.<br>
<br>  
<br>
In the course of time, I became a mother.<br>
<br>  
Since I grew up looking at my mother who was always busy with work, I was ill-equipped at parenting with absolutely no idea how to nurture or talk to a baby.<br>
<br>  
I didn't even know how I should express my love toward my own child.<br>
<br>  
Before I gave birth, I used to think very casually that it would be a breeze for me because I had taken care of my younger sisters, nieces and nephews.<br>
<br>  
However, that false confidence of mine was overturned 180 degrees, which made me feel even more negative.<br>
<br>  
<br>
Thanks to the great support from my husband, my children and my parents-in-law, I was able to attend cosmetology school.<br>
<br> 
In the class rooms, even my smallest accomplishment was acknowledged by the teachers and classmates, and they would give me hearty compliments.<br>
<br>  
But I didn't know how to accept them.<br>
<br>  
I couldn't genuinely accept those words of compliment.<br>
<br>  
It was completely different from what I grew up with.<br>
<br>  
I had no confidence in continuing with my education because I was not good at meeting people at school, making new friends, exchanging words with them, or doing things together with them.<br>
<br>  
When my family told me that I could quit whenever I wanted, I thought to myself that if I quit now, I would remain forever in my own comfortable shells.<br>
<br>  
And that wasn't what I wanted.<br>
<br>  
Due to the tremendous support from my family, I was able to obtain the California license as a cosmetologist.<br>
<br>  
During those two and a half years, my entire family, including my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law and her husband, my aunt and her husband spent a lot of time in lending support to me.<br>
<br>
