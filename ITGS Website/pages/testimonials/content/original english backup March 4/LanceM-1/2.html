<br>
When my son was 3, his parent divorced.<br>
<br>
When I was about 5, my father's new wife made him give up his children for adoption by my step-Dad.<br>
<br>
The woman I had the affair with, she wanted me to give up my children, but I could not.<br>
<br>
I wanted to change this karma, although I did not know how.<br>
<br>
I was one of those that heard about karma, but thought that I was able to avoid it.<br>
<br>
It was something that happened to other people, "not me."<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I only came back to the temple every 3-4 months, and everyone seemed so cold and impersonal to me now. <br>
<br>
I was sure they all knew. <br>
<br>
I did not know why all my "friends" suddenly seemed to push me away. <br>
<br>
But, I realize it was not them, it was me.<br>
<br>
My face and temperament had become stressed.<br>
<br>
I looked angry all the time, I was very sharp to others, and now people did not know what to say to me.<br>
<br>
I went from a happy, kind and funny person to somebody who was angry and very intense.<br>
<br>
My speech was very short and rapid.<br>
<br>
I had lost myself.<br>
<br> 
Others did not know why I had changed, and they were not sure how to interact with me.<br>
<br>
