There is a sono-uta that says:<br>
<br>
<i>Roadside grass is often trampled on, Yet has the spirit to endure and grow.</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have started to read the "Words of Confession and Repentance" each night, and instead of just repeating it as a chant, I have begun to learn how the words were meant for me.<br>
<br>
Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama chants this for us every Winter Training, but I feel that I want to step forward in life in response to his compassion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you, and I am happy to be able to practice with everyone from this temple.<br>
<br>
Thank you for the past 10 years. On my second sesshin, some 10 years ago, I was asked if I would follow this teaching for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
I was surprised at being asked this since I was just starting.<br>
<br>
I though about it, and then answered "hai."<br>
<br>
Although I did not expect the road to be so full of rocks and pits, my karma almost made me forget that promise. <br>
<br>
That determination has been re-kindled in my heart, and I look forward to walking the path with you for eternity.<br>
<br>
