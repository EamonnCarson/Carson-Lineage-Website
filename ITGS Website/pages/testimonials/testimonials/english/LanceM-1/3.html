At this time I was attending a Christian church, and even became baptized.<br>
<br>
But, I found now peace or happiness. <br>
<br>
It was one of the ironies of my life that I could not see how great Shinnyo-en was until I found myself in the arms of another faith.<br>
<br>
I saw so many people that were suffering at that church, with no clear direction for removing that suffering.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shinnyo-en has the three practices to help cut out karma.<br>
<br>
We have sesshin training to help us understand how that karma is affecting us in our daily lives.<br>
<br>
Shinnyo-en is a rightful teaching that points the way for us, we have but to listen, and make actual practice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My karma had destroyed my family, this other woman's family, shaken some of the office staff members, and caused concern and worry to people in the temple.<br>
<br>
For this, I am very sorry.<br>
<br>
I never wanted to hurt the temple or Shinnyo Keishu-sama.<br>
<br>
I can understand the concern now, but at the time I too was in pain, and kept asking myself "what about me?!"<br>
<br>
Here I was a Daikangi who had fallen into hell, and I was become very self-centered. <br>
<br>
I had lost my altruistic path.<br>
<br>
