Since I came to the U.S., I had devoted myself to the Shinnyo Teaching and raised my kids. Then I noticed two years had already passed.<br>
<br>
I was given an opportunity to attend the ceremony of the consecration of Ogen Center (Ogen'in) in Tachikawa, Japan.<br>
<br>
The Main Temple in Tachikawa looked the same as two years ago when I left Japan.<br>
<br>
Through the second gate, I saw: Kasanori-inari at the left; Betaiten and Seiryo-daigongen at the right; Jizo-bosatsu; Achala made from a polished stone; Shinyo-ji; the first main temple, the second main temple, and Eto-in.<br>
<br>
When I was standing in front of the Shinnyo Stupa, I felt like I was surrounded with the indescribable air, and I sensed as if the Shinnyo Parents and their Two Dojis were sitting and facing toward me.   <br>
<br>
"The Shinnyo Parents and the Two Dojis never give up on a person like me. They always care about me and they are ever present." I was just filled with gratitude.<br>
<br>
Last year, I received a great joy of the "grand opening of the USA Head Temple," and I was giving a lot of heartfelt care from the Shinnyo Parents and the Two Dojis. Then I made a determination, "From now on, I will try my best." <br>
<br>
The next month, however, my father passed away.<br>
<br>
"Why now? Why suddenly? He was only 69 years old..."<br>
<br>
I asked my mother what had happened on him in Japan?<br>
<br>
She said that he was in a condition that required him to have insulin injections due to diabetes. He also got a stomach cancer and a tumor in 5cm size in his stomach was found.<br>
<br>
She was also told that the doctor would cut the entire stomach off after my father's blood sugar level and body temperature drop.<br>
<br>
My father owned a small company with a small number of the employees, so he had to continue to work.<br>
<br>
I think because my husband and I had flown to America, he forced himself to work harder.<br>
<br>
If only he had visited a doctor at a hospital; if my husband and I had helped him in his company, he would have lived a bit longer.<br>
<br>
I regret that I should have conveyed the Shinnyo Teaching to him with more effort.<br>
<br>
Regretting it didn't bring my father back, but I kept thinking like that.<br>
<br>
I didn't imagine how pitiful it is to lose a family member.<br>
<br>
How much sorrow the Shinnyo Parents had when they lost the Two Dojis!  How sad Shinnyo Kyoshu sama was when he lost Shojushin'in sama!<br>
<br>
Through my father's passing away, I was able to realize even a bit that on the foundation made by those holy lives I was given the opportunities for receiving sesshin and for seeking the Path. <br>
<br>
That's why it happened in the month of June, in which we have Kyodoin sama's memorial and in the following two months, we have the Shinnyo Parents' and Shindoin sama's memorial. <br>
<br>
As it is said "from the consecration of the Sacred Site (Oyasono) to the consecration of our hearts," I would like, together with my husband, to be a person whom the Shinnyo Parents and the Two Dojis are proud of by changing from benefit-seeking myself to Buddha-centered myself, and become a true foundation for the people as soon as I can.<br>
