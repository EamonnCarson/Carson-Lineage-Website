My name is Yasuo Saito.<br>
<br>
I'd like to share my experiences in the past 10 years, especially about how the Shinnyo Teachings had helped myself, my relationship with my brother and relationship with my father.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First, I'd like to talk about how I had connected to Shinnyo-en.<br>
<br>
Back in the day when I had resided in Japan, I was a college student dreaming about living in the United States.<br>
<br>
After I graduated from college in Japan, I chose not to go job hunting, but instead I was working as a part-timer while I was preparing for coming to the United States.<br>
<br>
I was eventually able to enter college in Louisiana and upon graduation from college fortunately I got a job in Kentucky.<br>
<br>
Even though my job title was an engineer, I still didn't know what my actual job task was.<br>
<br>
Even though I can say that I would have been paid even without doing any work whatsoever with this company, I didn't like the job.<br>
<br>
One and half years later, there were reorganization in the company and I got laid off.<br>
<br>
One of the reasons I fest I was laid off was because I once told my manager I could not enjoy working there or I did not like my job.<br>
<br> Or something like that.<br>
<br>
I should have been more careful what I say.<br>
<br> I did not know back then it was one of my biggest problems that I had encountered.<br>
<br> 
But at that time, little did I know this problem would become larger and larger.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I lost my job and it was hard for me to find another job in a place like Kentucky, so I decided to move to California.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, I had a college classmate (actually my friend's friend) in Sacramento, California.<br>
<br> 
I can see this is like a ray of light of the Buddha guided me and my ancestors' last virtue to help me move to California.<br>
<br>
I had stayed in his apartment for two months.<br>
<br> Eventually he told me to get out.<br>
<br>
I guess he was sick of me because I could not find a job for two months.<br>
<br>
One day I sent my resume to 20 companies for seeking a translator position, I got only one response.<br>
<br>
The person who responded my resume is now my guiding parent.<br>
<br>
I had visited now-my-guiding-parent and now-my-lineage-parent for getting a job.<br>
<br>
They did not offer me a job, but eventually they had found a place for me to stay.<br>
<br>
Also they had asked me to visit Shinnyo-en.<br>
<br> On the same day, I had connected to Shinnyo-en.<br>
<br>
In fact, in my mind I was hesitated but I just followed along as they had asked me.<br>
<br>
I think I may have expected something good would happen if I go to Shinnyo-en.<br>
