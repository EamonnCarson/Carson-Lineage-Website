Lastly, I'd like to talk about my relationship with my father.<br>
<br>
I had seldom talked with my father even since when I was very little.<br>
<br> I had actually avoided him.<br>
<br>
I don't remember if he had ever praised me or said good things to me.<br>
<br> 
But from Shinnyo-en, I have learned that I'm not the only one who is suffering from relationship with parents.<br>
<br>
I guess my father wanted to talk with me, but he may have not known how to talk to me.<br>
<br>
Back when I started working right after my graduation from college in the US, I thought I would never go home.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the distance between my father and I was too big to reduce it.<br>
<br>
When my lineage parent advised me to send a letter every month to my parents, especially to my father, I did not know what to write about.<br>
<br> Nothing came out from my mind.<br>
<br>
I sent a letter every month with "naigai-jiho" and sometimes with "kangi-sekai."<br>
<br>
The each letter was just one page long, but it was very difficult for me to write.<br>
<br>
While I kept telling about my parents and receiving advice from my lineage parent, it looked like the tangled strings between my father and I were gradually getting loose by the Shinnyo Teachings.<br>
<br>
Recently, my lineage parent went to Japan and met with my parents.<br>
<br>
They visited the Tachikawa Holy Temple and promised her they would go to a Shinnyo-en branch nearby in the future.<br>
<br>
I was very happy that their future visit to a branch temple.<br>
<br>
However, I had not heard anything about their visit to a branch temple for 2 or 3 month since then.<br>
<br> 
So, I was so irritated their slowness that I decided to call my parents.<br>
<br>
When I was about to call, my father sent me e-mail about their visit to the branch temple.<br>
<br>
The news made me so happy.<br>
<br>
Now they are visiting the branch temple once a month, I'm working on for them to visit the temple frequently.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I am thinking to be a person who is dependable and who can always help others.<br>
<br>
I'd like to be a Shinnyo follower whom Shinnyo Keishu-sama would be proud of.<br>
<br>
I'd like to try to follow Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama's teachings.<br>
<br>
And I'd like to follow Shojushin'in-sama's path as examples.<br>
<br>
I'd like to appreciate the baku-daiju from the Ryodoji-sama.<br>
<br>
I am very appreciative of my lineage parent, my guiding parent, and the people who have always encouraged me.<br>
<br>
I'd like to walk the path of the Shinnyo Teachings with ever lasting faith.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much everyone for listening to my testimony.<br>
