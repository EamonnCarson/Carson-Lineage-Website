Next, I'd like to talk about what happened in my working places.<br>
<br>
I eventually I found a job.<br>
<br> My job was entering customer information into computer.<br>
<br>
I did not like that job.<br>
<br> Even though I did not have enough experience as an engineer, I had a big pride.<br>
<br> I thought the data entry job was for the uneducated people.<br>
<br> 
I complained about the job to everybody everyday.<br>
<br>
I had spoke ill of not only my manager but also my co-workers behind their back.<br>
<br>  
And even worse, I said a really bad thing about a co-worker behind his back like he had a love affair with someone.<br>
<br> 
Then he eventually heard it and he said with his anger, "Why did you say that!?"
Immediately after he had told me, I realized what I had said.<br>
<br> I apologized to him.<br>
<br>
I really regretted what I had said to the people around me.<br>
<br>
With advice from my lineage parent, I decided to work without complaints and also try to dedicate myself to the company.<br>
<br> I felt there was nowhere to go besides this company.<br>
<br>
A few months later, my manager told me, "Now I can trust you a bit."<br>
<br>
One day, the new administrator was hired and she started checking the employee data.<br>
<br>
Then suddenly I was laid off from the company.<br>
<br>
It wasn't due to my job performance.<br>
<br> Even it wasn't my fault, but it was due to some technical matter -- some immigration issue.<br>
<br>
In fact even my manager was surprised my sudden being laid off.<br>
<br>
Later, I would realize that the power of the baku-daiju was working on this event.<br>
<br>
I heard that the administrator left the company soon after I left.<br>
<br> It was as if she were hired only for laying me off.<br>
<br>
It turned out that it was the right time for me to leave the company and seek a new opportunity.<br>
<br>
I now realized that working for that company was my training working ethics or attitude in a company.<br>
<br> (Not technical skills)
Well, it's a shame that I did not know even basic working ethics back then.<br>
<br> 
Anyway, I started looking for a new job.<br>
<br>
I had several interviews, but I was rejected by all of them.<br>
<br>
Quite interestingly, these companies all extinct now.<br>
<br>
Even though I did not have income anymore, as lineage parent advised me I continued offering Kangi every month.<br>
<br>
I got a job offer from the last company I applied.<br>
<br> It was the last and only chance for my staying in the US.<br>
<br>
I now very appreciate the baku-daiju.<br>
