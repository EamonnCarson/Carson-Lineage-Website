When I was 19, I joined a Buddhist temple "Shinnyo-en," where the followers were (are) practicing based on the "last teaching" of the Buddha.<br>
<br>
  Two years later, I had an opportunity to meet the Shinnyo-en founder, Shinjo Ito.<br>
<br>
  There, he generously shook my hand.<br>
<br>
 Since then I have never had pains on my right leg at all.<br>
<br>
This is how I experienced it:<br>

It was June 3, 1984.<br>
<br>
 After hearing about my trip to the US for the first time in my life, Kyoshu-sama (Shinjo Ito) shook my hand and encouraged me, "Try your best there."<br>
<br>
I felt that something round and warm in orange like the sun coming out of his right hand and it entered through my right hand into my right arm while we were shaking hands.<br>
<br>
  It was like electricity running through in the bone of my right knee and it reached my right heel.<br>
<br>
 I got a indescribable comfort feeling.<br>
<br>
  I saw myself with large drops of tears clinging to his hand.<br>
<br>
  When I looked up at him, he was gazing upon my eyes and I felt he was asking me with his eyes, "Is that it?"  I answered in my mind, "Yes, this is where the pains are coming from!" <br>
<br>
  As soon as I answered, he grabbed my hand harder to make sure of it.<br>
<br>
  Suddenly I felt something like a long thin rod was slowly lifted up through in my right leg from the heel to the knee.<br>
<br>
  I felt something was pulled out of my body.<br>
<br>
  <i>It</i> quickly passed through my body and moved into Kyoshu-sama's hand that was still grabbing my hand.<br>
<br>
  I was filled with some kind of feeling like "I was given something precious."<br>
<br>
Then I noticed the way Kyoshu-sama was walking looked exactly like me.<br>
