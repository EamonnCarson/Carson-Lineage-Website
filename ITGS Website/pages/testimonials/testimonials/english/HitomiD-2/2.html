Despite all the blood tests, the results were all negative and the doctor did not have any other ideas on what to do.<br>
<br>
 His doctor had mentioned me that his symptom looked like some sort of blood disease or something related to the nerve and muscle, such as collagen disease.<br>
<br>
  I was shocked.<br>
  <br>
I called my lineage parent and mentioned this event to her and she suggested me to receive special consultation sesshin.<br>
<br>
  Fortunately, I was able to receive sesshin in the same week I took him to his doctor.<br>
<br>
 Through sesshin, an ancestor from my mother’s side and other people whose deaths were caused by water were indicated.<br>
<br>
  They may have died by a natural disaster or something else in relation to water.<br>
<br>
 Those people had been waiting for a very long time to meet someone who can understand their feelings, sufferings, and their pain.<br>
<br>
 They were finally able to meet the person who practices this great teaching and they were very sure that they would be saved at last; this caused such happiness for them.<br>
<br>
At that time, there was a Water consolatory osegaki booklet available so I did osegaki and offered my sincere prayers to this ancestor and other people who died with this ancestor.<br>
<br>
  When I thought about them, I became speechless, they had been waiting for a very long time to be saved by this teaching and finally they were.<br>
<br>
  I was able to feel their joy and appreciation to Sooya-sama, Ryodoji-sama and Shinnyo Keishu-sama.<br>
<br>
  I realized that I wasn’t able to catch this ancestor’s message even though they had been showing me through my son.<br>
<br>
  They’d been trying so hard to be found but because of my lack of every day’s prayer to Sooya-sama, Ryodoji-sama, and Shinnyo Keishu-sama, and because I didn’t take my son’s symptom seriously, I missed the important message from them.<br>
<br>
 That’s why my son acted unusual to my mother in law who’s my lineage parent in order to be saved.<br>
<br>
  Since I received sesshin and did osegaki, he never had swollen fingers or feet ever again.<br>
<br>
  This was nothing but the miracle of this teaching, power of Saisho and bakudaiju.<br>
<br>
   I was able to re-realize the importance of praying every single second of life.<br>
<br>
 If I pray to Sooya-sama, Ryodoji-sama, and Shinnyo Keishu-sama, I can catch the messages that have for me.<br>
<br>
 If I don’t, then I can’t catch those messages.<br>
<br>
 Now, I can feel Sooya-sama, Ryodoji-sama, and Shinnyo Keishu-sama’s compassionate heart and unstoppable love and kindness.<br>
<br>
  To show my gratitude, I vow to become a spiritual medium one day as soon as possible and lead one more person to this teaching to help create a more harmonious world.<br>
<br>
  I will follow Shinnyo Keishu-sama and protect this teaching for the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
