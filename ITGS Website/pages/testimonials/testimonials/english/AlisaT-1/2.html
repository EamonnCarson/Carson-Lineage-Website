I was 18 years old when I moved to Japan, graduating from High school, starting college, and working full time.<br>
<br>
Just to give you a bigger picture of where I was heading, I graduated at the bottom of my class, college lasted for one semester, and working 3 to 5 jobs.<br>
<br>
During this time I also began drinking alcohol more, which led to a car accident and other very bad decisions which then led to my suffering.<br>
<br>
During this time, my father tried so hard to practice, I, on the other hand did not.<br>
<br>
Tonight, I would like to thank my father for practicing because, if he hadn't I think I would have been very unhappy today, or maybe even dead!  Thank you DAD! <br>
<br>
Finally, after many mistakes that lead to many reasons for my unhappiness, I moved to Denver, Colorado in 1993, where I was blessed to meet the love of my life.<br>
<br>
We were married 3 years later, and went to Japan. Our life in Japan began, like any other marriage, full of bliss and hope.<br>
<br>
But things didn't stay that way for very long, my husband and I were unfortunate to lose our first child, during my pregnancy, and then I began to change.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I did not know this at the time.<br>
<br>
Let me just say this right now before I go on, that this testimony has been very difficult for me and my husband to share, but our hope is that through telling this story that you can see how, through practicing this precious teaching you can overcome anything.<br>
<br>
I also have to say thank you to my husband for giving me the permission to speak to you all today, about such a personal thing in our lives.<br>
<br>
THANK YOU, MICHAEL.<br>
<br>
<br>
Continuing my story, as I was saying I began to change, the anger I felt of losing a child led me to blame my husband, which led to my ignorance of not seeing the pain my husband was also going through and also the greed of wanting something to replace the pain led me to drift apart from my husband.<br>
<br>
ANGER, GREED, AND IGNORANCE (or DELUSIONS), are what we followers call  the 3 poisons or the "3 unwholesome roots."<br>
<br>
When one's greed is not satisfied, one becomes angry.<br>
<br>
Blinded by the anger, one acts foolishly out of ignorance.<br>
<br>
The three unwholesome roots binds one to the cycle of transmigration, which is the cycle of rebirths in body and mind, or cycle of existence.<br>
<br>
This all prevents a person to be unhappy.<br>
<br>
As you can see that is where I was headed. UNHAPPY!
