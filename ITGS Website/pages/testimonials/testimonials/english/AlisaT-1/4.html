Finally, after those few conversations with my student I gathered enough courage to go to Oyasono with her one afternoon, with my head hanging down, with feelings of shame and guilt.<br>
<br>
As we walked through the courtyard, and into the temple, my heart raced and before I knew it I was standing in front of the remains of my Spiritual Parents and their sons with tears running down my face, apologizing for not coming sooner, I vowed that day to go back to the United States and to practice again with determination.<br>
<br>
Life was not easy at first, when I came back to the U.S., but I promised my Spiritual Parents and their sons who gave up there life so early for us followers to carry our burden so we could practice the teachings of the Buddha's and live in a life of Permanence, Bliss and Self-Purity.<br>
<br>
So, here I am today practicing with my husband, two boys, dad and guiding children or what I like to say "FRIENDS."<br>
<br>
I am grateful for the Shinnyo Teaching, as it points the way for everyone, to listen and see the "REAL STATE OF THINGS" and make actual effort to change ourselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would like to share a quote with you from Founder Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama:  <br>
<br>
<i>
People around us serve as mirrors that reflect what we project or perhaps the negative tendencies we, too, have inside of us.<br>
<br>
  When we have thoughts like, "They don't understand," or, "They're are giving me a hard time," it is we who are causing ourselves grief, not others.<br>
<br>
  Such moments are opportunities to reflect on our attitude or state of mind."<br>

I wish I knew what this meant over 20 years ago, when I first got connected, because it would have saved my husband a lot pain.<br>
<br>
I would like to this time to truly say to my husband "I'm sorry."<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
