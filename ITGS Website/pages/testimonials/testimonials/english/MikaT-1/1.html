My name is Mika Tanaka. I live in Japan. <br>
<br>
It was 28 years ago when I heard the name "Shinnyo-en" for the first time from my college friend. <br>
<br>
At that time, "Shinnyo-en" didn't sound important to me, so I paid no attention to it and I asked her no question about it.<br>
<br>
When I was little, my parents divorced. My mother left home for work at a distanced area, so my grandparents took care of my younger brother and me.<br>
<br>
I put up with loneliness of the lack of my parents around me, and because I did not want to be a burden for my grandparents, I had kept saying myself since then, "Do not ask for anything to them." I had lived as if I had been tough enough.<br>
<br>
Therefore, rather than paying attention to "Shinnyo-en", my main concern was to be a certified child-care nurse as soon as I could to make a living.<br>
<br>
Around then, my younger brother got involved in a huge accident. He was in coma and my mother had stayed at the hospital to nurse him.<br>   
<br>
I helped my mother every day after school to nurse my brother. It was a hard time for us.<br>
<br>
On the 40th day since the accident, he suddenly opened his eyes. But due to the side-effects of the accident, he got a speech impediment and his left limbs were paralyzed. <br>
<br>
Although my college friend again talked about Shinnyo-en not only to me but also to my family, I did not realize its importance. Even now I don't recall what she actually told me at all.<br>    
<br>
(She recalls now that at that time she was wondering how to convey her thoughts about Shinnyo-en to me, as I'm now in the similar situation to her for "otasuke.")<br>
<br>
I said to myself for the hardship my family was facing, "We must survive somehow only ourselves."<br>
<br>
I knew that one has one's own problems. But at that time I didn't understand that those problems originate from one's own karma.<br>
<br>
Instead, I thought like "Why is this happened to me, even though I'm trying to live earnestly?" and I blamed something else without reflecting on myself.<br>
<br>
Since graduating from the college, my college friend and I seldom got touch with each other and eventually we totally lost contact. <br>
<br>
I didn't know why, but whenever I remembered her, the name "Shinnyo-en" appeared, and whenever the name "Shinnyo-en" appeared in my mind, I remembered her. Then I thought, "Does she still go to Shinnyo-en? What is she doing there?"<br>
<br> 
She and I used to exchange the letters and told each other about how our lives were, but after both of us moved and changed our addresses, we had lost contacts.<br>
<br>
One day, I thought there would been no way to meet her unless I had done something. I suddenly said to myself, "I have to call her now!"<br>
<br>      
I somehow found out the phone number of her parents' house, and I dialed the number as I was saying to myself, "I can't miss this chance!" At the same time, she was also trying to contact me from America.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, when she received the spiritual words back then, "One of the seeds of "otasuke" you had sown has already grown in the soil and now it has become a sprout. You may accomplish something in this year," and she thought the seed would be me.<br>
<br>
When she contacted me on the phone, I told her how my life had unexpectedly changed: I had a debt and loan, got divorced, and suffered pains of rheumatism after undergoing leg joint surgery. Due to those, I was depressed and diagnosed with panic disorder. I often got rapid heartbeat and panting, so I was too scared to go out. I wanted to die. I wanted to go away somewhere. I wasn't even unable to work...<br>
<br>
I was trying not to cry. She patiently listened to me, then said, "You'd better be connected to Shinnyo-en."<br>
<br>
By her firm voice, I imaged her totally different from what she was when we were college students, and I sensed something very strong in her.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, I realized myself how wimpy I was.<br>
<br>
Thus, it took 28 years for me to be finally connected to Shinnyo-en in September 2008.<br>
<br>
<br>
In that year, I was unable to attend the home meetings due to my bad health conditions. Even when I went to a Shinnyo-en temple, my body trembled by rapid heartbeat and fear due to my panic disorder.<br>
<br>
I was undergoing the rehabilitation and I had pains on my left hip joints. My body frequently became numb. I needed help from my children for the house chores and even for changing my clothes.<br>
<br>
So, I only paid attention on my hardship, and I had kept thinking that rather visiting Shinnyo-en or attending the home meetings, the medication and frequent visit to the doctor were the best treatment for me.<br>
<br>
