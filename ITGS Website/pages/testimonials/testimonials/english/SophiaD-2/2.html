Hello everyone.<br><br><br>I'm 11 years old now, and I'm very grateful for having you to read my proof.<br><br>This proof withholds a joyous point in times of when I felt lighthearted and blithe by the power of the Shinnyo Parents.<br><br>I hope you enjoy reading this.<br><br><br>There are times of when I'm fearful, glad, and irritable but I always know that the Shinnyo Parents are there with me.<br><br>I enjoy reading Shinnyo-en books at night that my mom kindly retrieves for me.<br><br> Whenever I read them, I learn more about the past times of Shinnyo-en.<br><br> There's always some kind of feeling when I read these books though.<br><br> That's the presence of the Shinnyo Parents, Kyoshu sama and Shojushin-in sama.<br><br> The everlasting bliss and secure sentient of the Shinnyo Parents.<br><br><br>Whenever me and my family go to Shinnyo-en, we feel the love and compassion of millions of people.<br><br> As I stroll around the affectionate temple, I'm greeted by many people doing gohoshi.<br><br> The Shinnyo parents would always greet many people too.<br><br> Even on brisk, or steaming days, they would greet us with heart warming smiles.<br><br> I feel myself purify as I dawdle there in awe.<br><br><br>I can remember the first time I received my first, jubilant sesshin.<br><br> As I treaded the patted room, I felt a mixture of delight and pleasure.<br><br> Also, I felt confident because my dad was sitting there behind me.<br><br> Even though my mom was in the Harmony Room, I could imagine her, waiting to listen to my first sesshin.<br><br> I squatted there on the golden paved floor, meditating.<br><br> I awaited and longed for the words and felt like as if the Shinnyo Parents were there with me.<br><br> At last, the words came to me, wrapping around my ears like a soothing melody.<br><br> "Gently smile to everyone so everyone will realize that they should be happy too."<br><br>After the sesshin, I jotted it down and narrate to my mom on what happened.<br><br> I began to gradually smile as my parents drove the bustling car.<br><br> I felt as if the Shinnyo Parents was smiling at me too as the temple filled with smiles.<br><br><br> Recently, I have learned some kind of topic on, "unborn children."<br><br>I learned that I was almost one of them.<br><br> They are with us too, just as the Shinnyo Parents would recall.<br><br> They're not on earth and yet, the could observe what we are doing each day.<br><br> The unborn children wants us to be filled with glee each day and for us to be grateful for everything.<br><br> Shinso Ito, or known now as Keishu sama, always remembers to give a sincere "thank you" as a sign of thankfulness.<br><br> We should be grateful for what we have now and cherish it.<br><br> Remember that the Unborn Children are not on earth and want to try and strive like we do.<br><br> So always say, "Thank you," to show that you are fortunate too.<br><br> Then the unborn children will be happy.<br><br> Whenever I have problems, I have overcome them with the potent power of  Shinnyo-en.<br><br> Each day I learn, to become a more better person.<br><br> Then I realize that I should not be selfish, I should be more altruistic and lead others to Shinnyo-en.<br><br> So they could feel the loving warmth Shinnyo-en.<br><br> With pure salvation and warm happiness, I shall walk the Buddha path, leading others with me.<br><br><br>Thank you very much for your time and consideration into reading my proof.<br><br> I hope you can teach others this valuable, precious teaching.<br><br> Then, you and me together, can conduct a harmonious world among us.<br><br> That, is the Buddha's wish.<br><br> Thank you.<br><br>
