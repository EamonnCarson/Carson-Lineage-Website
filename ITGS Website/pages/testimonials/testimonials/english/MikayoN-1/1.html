I have an experience that made me feel, "Sesshin training is precious." <br>
<br>
I was connected to Shinnyo-en over 20 years ago through a problem which I couldn't even share with my own family.<br>
<br>
I was living in Japan at that time. <br>
<br>
I visited the temple a day after I heard about Shinnyo-en.<br>
<br>
There was no service on that day, however.<br>
<br>
The temple I visited had just been dedicated 3 months before, and it was the only Shinnyo-en sanctuary in the Kyushu region.<br>
<br> 
(Now, there is a Shinnyo-en sanctuary in each prefecture in Kyushu.)<br>
<br>
There wasn't any service that day, but from the moment I saw the Great Nirvana Buddha image sculpted by Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama, I felt happy all the way home and for the next few days.<br>
<br>
I told my family, relatives and friends that "I became really happy after I went to the place called Shinnyo-en." <br>
<br>
(I didn't know what I was doing then was called Otasuke.)<br>
<br>
Some of them got connected to Shinnyo-en.<br>
<br>
Right around the time when I was inviting one of my aunts to go, saying, "Aunty, why don't you go at least once?" <br>
<br>
I received the following spiritual words in my fourth Sesshin:<br>
<br>  
<br>
<i>"Have you done Otasuke?<br>
<br>
Someone who’s shaking his/her head is indicated, in trying not to hear what you have to say. <br>
<br>
This person’s hands are in pain. <br>
<br>
Maybe from arthritis?  <br>
<br>
His/her back is hurting, too. <br>
<br>
How about the blood pressure?  <br>
<br>
Try speaking to this person about the Teaching 30 times.  <br>
<br>
If he/she still doesn’t want to do it, then, nothing can be done.  <br>
<br>
This person may not have any big trouble or concerns right now.  <br>
<br>
But later on, he/she may face some irreversible, big difficulty. <br>
<br>
Is this person pursing the Shinnyo Teaching yet?  <br>
<br>
Please encourage him/her to do so to have the spiritual tie with the Buddha.  <br>
<br>
Please read the Path of Oneness, the Nirvana and Joyous World often and do Otasuke on this person."<br></i>
