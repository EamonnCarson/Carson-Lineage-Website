After that Sesshin, I frequently visited this aunt with my sister who used to go to Shinnyo-en with me.  <br>
<br>
After inviting her about 10 times to Shinnyo-en, my aunt said, "If you encourage me so much, I'll give it a try," and she became a member.  <br>
<br>
Because I felt so happy when I first visited the temple, I assumed that she would feel the same.  <br>
<br>
I asked her, "Aunty, do you feel happy?"<br>
<br>
But she was dissatisfied because of the large crowd of followers and because I rushed her from this place to the next. <br>
<br>
Through this experience, I learned how difficult Otasuke is due to individual differences.<br>   
<br>
Afterwards, her level of faith was such that she would only request Osegaki and read the Nirvana issues at home.  <br>
<br>
She was often visited at home by so-called, "professional spiritual mediums/faith healers"  <br>
<br>
Even though she was connected to Shinnyo-en, she would often request special prayers from these people.  <br>
<br>
When she was just about ready to start receiving Sesshin training, she left Shinnyo-en.<br>  
<br>
I was scheduled to move to America. <br>
<br>
My mother started to return to the temple around that time.  <br>
<br>
A few years later, the same aunt was guided back to Shinnyo-en by my mother.  <br>
<br>
She attended home meetings, and her daughter became a member as well.  <br>
<br>
Both of them started to receive Sesshin and engage in Three Practices.  <br>
<br>
Another few years later, my aunt received Daijo spiritual level in her 70's.  <br>
<br>
Her daughter was accepted to study in Chiryugakuin missionary school.  <br>
<br>
Her husband (my uncle) fell ill around that time and he required the nursing care at home afterward.  <br>
<br>
Later he passed on.  <br>
<br>
Soon after that, her daughter that she was depended upon became ill with cancer.  <br>
<br>
At her last moment, her doctor asked the family, "Are you practicing any faith?  <br>
<br>
Normally, the end is not as peaceful as her case."<br>
