I saw Shinnyo Keishu-sama at the Chicago Opening, were I was still slide down into hell from the weight of this karma. <br>
<br>
Then, again I saw her at the new Seattle temple opening.<br>
<br>
I was watching the kids again, and She looked at me and gave another heaping of her compassion.<br>
<br>
At this point I was no longer seeing the woman who I had the affair with, and I felt a desire to find my path again.<br>
<br>
In Seattle I happened to run into an old friend there that picked me up was able to show me the direction to start back.<br>
<br>
For his help, I am very grateful.<br>
<br>
It was Shinnyo Keishu-sama who became my beacon in the fog that I was in. <br>
<br>
She never gave up on me, and for that I would like to give my heartfelt gratitude and appreciation.<br>
<br>
I have a disciple’s love for Shinnyo Keishu-sama, who is my teacher, and a living Buddha.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am very grateful for being able to give this proof during the first year of the Universal Training Ground, for I feel that this is now my first year also.<br>
<br>
I will strive to pull myself out of this karmic mud hole, and to become a Spiritual Medium to serve the followers.<br>
<br>
I will work hard to become a Missionary to serve the Buddha and the world.<br>
<br>
I hope to someday complete my vow to Sooya-sama and Shinnyo Keishu-sama, and complete my task to support Shinny Keishu-sama in the Saito Homa, at the Universal Training Ground, and here in the USA.
