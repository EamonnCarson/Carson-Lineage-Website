During my three-year junior-high era, I played volleyball. I went to school by bicycle, too.<br>
<br>
Playing volleyball in those 3 years was the only sport activity I had.<br>
<br>
I guessed this sport activity, when I was 13, helped me grow up 7cm and I became tall for my age.<br>
<br>
But at the same time, I got severe pains in the several joints.<br>
<br>
A doctor advised my parents, "If we cut the muscle behind the knee and stretch it, she can walk smoothly but at the same time she won't be able to bend her knee when she sits."<br>
<br>
They declined the advice.<br>
<br>
<br>
In every my high school day, even when I was doing nothing I had pains so severe that I wished I could cut my entire right leg off.<br>
<br>
  I got a back pain, too.<br>
<br>
 Usually I put my weight on my left leg as I walked, and that caused an inflammation on my left hip joint.<br>
<br>
  Sometimes I couldn't even walk at all.<br>
<br>
  The pain killer drug given from the hospital only worked for 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
  So, my parents tried many things to relieve my pains such as by warming my leg up, giving me massages, asking benefit seeking religious groups, and so on.<br>
<br>
While they were trying their efforts, I kept worrying myself, like "Why do I have this kind of leg?" "Why do I have to live with those pains?" "Why me?" "What will my life be?"  <br>
<br>
Because people kept asking me about my leg and because people kept staring at me, my leg "took over" my thoughts.<br>
<br>
  Even when people were laughing with no reason, I considered they were laughing at my leg.<br>
<br>
  I couldn't have a dream and hope.<br>
<br>
<br>
At age 17 or so, I thought about committing suicide several times, but I couldn't do that as I imagined my parents' sorrow on my death and as I wondered the life after death.<br>
<br>
  I used to write down all my worries on my notebook and shout toward gods in my room, "Please help me!"  I thought, "I won't be able to get married anyway, and I will keep giving my family troubles."<br>
<br>
 "All my friends will live in their own ways, not like me."<br>
<br>
 I want to die at age 24.<br>
<br>
I decided to live through age 18 to 24 by doing whatever I want and I actually started doing so.<br>
<br>
 That gave my family a hard time.<br>
