I'd like to talk about what happened in the next company.<br>
<br>
The company I started working for was relatively big and it supported the cost for my greencard process.<br>
<br>
Even though I started attending the daijo-eza then, I started to forget to appreciate every thing I had received (like baku-daiju) and I started to take everything for granted.<br>
<br>
I was gradually ignoring my lineage parent's advice .Then I became interested in a female co-worker .She was also a non-US-citizen employee.<br>
<br>
I kind of sensed that her background was not very clear.<br>
<br> 
I looked like she was hiding her immigration status or it seemed like she was trying to trick the government for her immigration status.<br>
<br> But I did not care about that.<br>
<br>
I sometimes gave her a ride on the way home from work.<br>
<br>
My lineage parent sensed she was not a good person and tried to stop me my involvement with her.<br>
<br>
But I ignored my lineage parent's advice and I ignored the Shinnyo Teachings.<br>
<br>
One day, when I was giving her a ride from the office, I got a traffic accident.<br>
<br> 
Even though I lost my car, because of the baku-daiju from the Ryodoji-sama she and I did not get any injury result from the accident.<br>
<br>
Ironically, I got a ride from my lineage parent for commuting to work doing the time of the accident.<br>
<br>
I had given a very hard time not only to my lineage parent, but also to everybody around me.<br>
<br>
My lineage parent told me it was a riburai (reply) from the spiritual world.<br>
<br>
My lineage parent also said, "when the eza was approaching, your karma will emerge on your weakest area in your heart."<br>
<br> But I kept rejecting all the advice.<br>
<br>
I lied to my lineage parent many times for meeting her.<br>
<br>
But my lineage parent was already sensed I was lying.<br>
<br>
I was staying at my lineage parent house and at last my lineage parent told me to get our from the house.<br>
<br>
She said, "You should quit the Shinnyo Teachings."<br>
<br>
I had only one string attached with the Teachings and it was almost coming off.<br>
<br>
I was very severely in pain with my karma.<br>
<br>
Finally I woke up. I finally understood. I stopped lying.<br>
<br>
A few months later, I was able to receive the daijo spiritual rank.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much Shinnyo Soya-sama and Ryodoji-sama.<br>
