I made a lot of mistakes in English. I didn't know what to do when a customer told me he would like to "take out" his food because I didn't know what "take out" meant.<br>
<br>
I had no idea about the "unfiltered liquor." One customer walked to the refrigerator with me and pointed it out, "Here."<br>
<br>
Later, that customer was connected to Shinnyo-en, and I started seeing him at the temple sometimes. Whenever I greeted him at the temple, I remembered that incident and I felt embarrassed.<br>
<br>
The owner of the restaurant shouted at me whenever I made a mistake. He had a loud voice, so the customers looked at me. I felt ashamed and disgraced.<br>
<br>
"You don't have to be so mad. I didn't want to make mistakes either," I thought.<br>
<br>
One day, even though I was on my way to work, I decided to return home. Then, a story about Shindoin sama came up in my mind:<br>
<br>
<i>When Shindoin sama told his mother (Shojushin'in sama), "I don't want to go to school because I will be bullied," she scolded him, "Do you still want to create another burden to your father (Shinnyo Kyoshu sama)?" After that, he prayed at the Shincho-ji temple, and went to school on the next day.</i><br>
<br>
I had a hard time, but because of that, I was able to understand (even a little of) Shindoin sama's experience. <br>
<br>
When I felt that I was fortunate to be able to realize it, I broke into tears. Then, I decided to try my best.<br>
<br>
Since then, I wasn't depressed anymore, even when the owner shouted at me.<br>
<br>
Instead, I accepted it with gratitude. I started thinking that he shouted at me because he cared about me.<br>
<br>
