I'd like to talk about how I had treated the people around me in those days.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
While being employed in this company, it was a good salary comparing to my previous jobs I had, and I was always wondering and worrying about my future job carrier.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
My job position was software tester, but I wanted to be a software programmer.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I also felt I was getting behind among most of the co-workers who were well skilled and knowledgeable.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And I remember back then what I did toward the people in Shinnyo-en was something like:
Whenever someone pointed out something to me, I had always started argument.<br>
<!--replaced br--> I never agreed nor admit my fault.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Also sometimes I complained toward some of the gohoshi people about their bus operation or sesshin ticket operation.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I complained very harshly against a couple of Shinnyo-en office members for a very small stuff.<br>
<!--replaced br--> My attitude was like, "You were wrong and I was right." "I'm correcting you." Or something like that.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I really regret my attitude now.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I felt I gradually understood myself through the Shinnyo Teachings.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
Since the 9-11 incident, every year the company I am working for had a big lay-off and each time I tried to imagine how the Soya-sama and the Ryodoji-sama had overcome many difficulties, especially the dharma crisis.<br>
<!--replaced br--> (To tell the truth, I was always nervous and scared, though.)<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Also it became difficult to receive greencard since 9-11.<br>
<!--replaced br--> But after three years I was finally able to receive one.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Most of the people around me in the company who were waiting for a greencard were laid off.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
I really see now how much baku-daiju I have received from the Ryodoji-sama.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
Now I'd like to talk about my brother.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Back then I had a twin brother living in Japan.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
When I thought of my brother, I wanted to tell him that Shinnyo Teachings is only way for our happiness.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I started sending letters about Shinnyo-en among with other stuff.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
He first strongly rejected anything about Shinnyo-en.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
When he visited me from Japan during his vacation, I talked about Shinnyo-en and even I brought him to the Temple.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
It took quite a while to make him understand about Shinnyo-en.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
When he decided to come to the US to attend school, he started to come to the Temple.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'd like to practice with him more in the Teachings.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I hope that in the future my brother and I will become a Reino-sha and we together walk the path of the Shinnyo Teachings in the US.<br>
