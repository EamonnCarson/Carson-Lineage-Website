Now our new life in the U.S. had started. But I had to get a driver license first.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Even though I was driving in Japan, it was not easy for me to get a license in America.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I failed the driving test even in my third attempt. I had to take the written test again.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I passed the written test, but again, I failed the driving test.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I failed the fifth driving test in total. "I don't need the driver license. I don't care even if I can't go anywhere," I thought.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I wanted to go back to Japan because one doesn't need a car in Japan and he/she can go anywhere by bus or by train.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
My husband was unable to come with me for my driving test anymore. I made the appointment and drove to the DMV myself.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
If I failed again, I would have to start over with the written test. I was so nervous. I hadn't been this nervous since I gave birth to my kids.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Even though I finally got the driver license, I became more worried like, "I wonder if I can really live in America or not."<br>

When my husband and I were working in my father's company in Tokyo, we had to work even on weekends whenever he asked us so.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Thus, we only went to the temple once a month in Japan, and now I expected to go to the temple in the U.S. more often.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
But my husband didn't find a job for three months.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Unexpectedly I found a job before he did. He, who was not good at baby-sitting, took care of our kids, and I, who was not good at working, got a job instead. It was a huge shock for me.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I got a job as a waitress, but I had never done that before. I started working both at the lunch and dinnertime.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I complained, "Why do I have to work from the morning to the late night?" "Is this what I came to America for?"<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Together with my homesickness, I felt miserable and unbearable, and I didn't know how to deal with my feelings. I was frustrated all the time.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When I talked about my feelings to the pictures of Shinnyo Parents and the Two Dojis, I heard a soundless voice, "Try and do your best."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
My foster lineage parent and the people around me kept encouraging me with their warm hearts.<br>
