 We were connected to Shinnyo-en in 2001, but never been active at the temple.<br>
<br>
Living in a small apartment we didn't have to pay so many bills, so we were living pretty comfortable.<br>
<br>
 So our immaturity made us think that we had enough money to own a house.<br>
<br>
Everyone doing it, so why not? We decided to buy a condominium.<br>
<br>
 So we moved to a place called San Leandro without receiving any sesshin, and I didn't do any "jokubodai" to my guiding parent.<br>
<br>
 Soon after we moved to San Leandro my husband lost his job for about three month.<br>
<br>
 Even then I did not try to look for a job.<br>
<br>
  I never wanted to go to work because of my selfish weak-self.<br>
<br>
 A few years later I started to work here and there but never full time or stable income to help my husband.<br>
<br>
 And caused so much stress on my husband that he got back doing his drug habit again.<br>
<br>
 That's when I sought for help from my guiding parent.<br>
<br>
 She was so caring  and helped us in many ways even though she was having a hard time herself.<br>
<br>
 I am so sorry for all that worries that I cause to my guiding parent and my lineage parent.<br>
<br>
 Over the years we were having a hard time to pay mortgage and other bills.<br>
<br>
We tried to sell our house took us take a long time to decide to either sell or not we had in market for about a year.<br>
<br>
 At the time there were many people just like us who bought the house.<br>
<br>
 But so many were foreclosed, some people had to go to a homeless shelter to survive.<br>
<br>
 We could really have been one of them. Today we are able to keep the house.<br>
<br>
 We received so much "bakku-daiju" from Shinnyo Soya-sama and Ryodoji-sama.<br>
<br>
 It took so many years to open my eyes and listen.<br>
<br>
  I still have a problem myself, but really (REALLY!) enough me enough me.<br>
<br>
 (Try to tell myself to think of others first.) <br>
 <br>
 I don't know if I ever going to be like Shinnyo Soya-sama or Ryodoji-sama or Shinnyo Keisyu-sama.<br>
<br>
 But I really feel that this teaching made me a better person than before.<br>
<br>
 I will continue my practice until I die.<br>
<br>
 So it won't be another mistake in my sons' generations or next.<br>
<br>
I thought my life I can't enough "zange." <br>
<br>
But I will continue practicing the Shinnyo teaching no matter what happens in my life and keep this teaching and move forward for the world peace. <br>
 <br>
 Thank you so much for reading my testimony today.<br>
