One time, when I received Sesshin training, I received an indication of many unborn babies who were related to my and my husband's side of the family.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
They were not able to come into this world and experience mother's love.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
They must feel lonely, sad, and wish that they could feel even a fraction of my happiness.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
On the other hand, how much appreciation do I really have for all the happiness I have received though the teaching?  I feel ashamed and humbled about that.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
As a matter of fact, I felt I received a "message" recently.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
When I was forgetting about the spiritual words that I received through Sesshin or when I lacked my awareness of the unborn babies related to me, my children wouldn't go to sleep easily.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
No matter how tired they were, they didn't fall asleep.<br>
<!-- replaced br --> 
They would sometimes wake up crying soon after they fell asleep.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
Also, when my children reached for my hand to hold it, I would pull it away from them unintentionally.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
When I noticed it, I wondered why I couldn't be more warm and tender toward my children.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
I thought any ordinal parents could hug their children or hold hands with them.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
Why can't I be like that?  But I was acting this way unconsciously.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
Because it continued for a few days, I reflected as to why.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
Then, when I was offering the evening chanting with my children, it hit me.<br>
<!-- replaced br --> 
"Oh, it's the unborn babies!" Right afterwards, I talked with my children about how I was forgetting to have sincere heart toward them.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
From that evening, my children slept deeply through the night.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
It was really amazing.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
When my children came to give me a hug or to hold my hands, I thought of the unborn babies in the spiritual world and replied with my wholehearted love.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
Then, my children would give me the most wonderful smile, which in turn made me so happy.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
I regret that I should have realized it much sooner and gave my full affection to my children.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
However, I will never fail to have the gratitude for having had this realization at all.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
I will not forget the warm and compassionate heart of Shojushin'in-sama.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->  
As I raise my children, I will continue to show my affection to them more and more, so that they will not feel the way I did.<br>

Thank you very much.<br>
