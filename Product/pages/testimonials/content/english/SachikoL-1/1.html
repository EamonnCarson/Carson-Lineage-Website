My name is Sachiko Levu.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'm very happy now. I don't have any personal problem, and my husband Dave takes care of me very well.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
People I meet every day are giving me no harm but smiles.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I feel as if I were embraced in warm rain, and I realize that I am given a life in this very moment.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I already have enough. I'd like to pour this warm rain to someone else instead.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'd like to express my deepest gratitude toward the Guardians of the Law, Shinnyo Parents, Ryodoji-sama, and Shinnyo Keishu-sama for letting me know that I was given my life in this environment.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I greatly appreciate that my ancestors and their related sprits are whishing me happiness from the distance.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Until I have reached this gratitude, many of my problems have been solved (by the Shinnyo spiritual world).<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
Today, I'd like to talk about the problems between my mother and me.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
My father has been paralyzed for 16 years. And my mother has been connected to the Shinnyo Teaching for a long time.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was connected 15 years ago. When I was 36, I finally got married to my husband now, and in the same year as I conveyed my gratitude toward both my husband and my parents, I was elevated to Daijo spiritual level.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
Before getting married, I had lived with my parents to help them financially, to keep encouraging my mother, and mainly to enjoy an easy life as a bachelor girl.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
As being a person like that, there were many obstacles against my marriage.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And even after coming to the US, both my mother and I had the same emotional pains of being separated and living in different countries.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
These emotional pains appeared when I was thinking about getting married to a non-Japanese man.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I thought about having a "joku-bodai" with my lineage parent, but I had no courage to do so because I didn't want to talk about my family matters in order to make my lineage parent understand my pain.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And after all, I had no confidence in myself because I felt ashamed for still depending on my parents as a bachelor girl.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I came to the US with this emotional pain. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I wanted my foster lineage parent to know about myself, but somehow I couldn't talk about this emotional pain. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It was more painful for not being able to talk about my pain.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
In May 2009, when my parents visited me all the way to the Bay Area from Japan, this emotional pain was gone.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
As soon as they arrived, my mother received a special consultative sesshin about how to make up her mind toward my paralyzed father.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then, my mother told my foster lineage parent about the sesshin she received, about her personal issues, and about me.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
The spiritual words indicated nothing about my father at all but only about my mother. On the same day, my emotional pain disappeared.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
At that time, my mother only cared about money, the house, and my brother as the family successor, and she also worried about being alone after my father dies.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
After my foster lineage parent listened to my mother, she showed the directions my mother should take in the Buddha's way<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was quietly listing to her like an observer. I saw that one by one, the problems clearly emerged.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
While listening to my foster lineage parent, I was able to see my pains cleared up one by one. I felt better and relieved. <br>
