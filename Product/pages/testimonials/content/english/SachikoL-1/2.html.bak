Even though the influenza virus was spreading, as the Buddha protected my parents, they arrived San Francisco without any trouble.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Though it seemed to be difficult for my parents to come to the US, the fact that they safely arrived was the sign that indicated the way to the resolution of the problems.<br> 
<!--replaced br-->
When my mother left Fukuoka city, Japan, she and I had a long talk on the phone and we made up our minds, "While we are in this world, we shall firmly walk on the path of the Shinnyo Teaching."<br>
<!--replaced br-->
The Shinnyo Parents must have been listening to us and they must have given the opportunity to my parents to trip to the US to take out our burden.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
They showed our family to the path to the happiness.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
After coming back to Japan, my mother joined a support group for the handicaps in order to help as many people as she could, and she also started attending an English conversation class.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
After my father went back to Japan, he was hospitalized, but he was completely treated and he became better than he was before.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
Through their trip to the US in May 2009, the problem my mother and I were holding became clear, and the resolution of the problem was given. My pain that I had been holding in myself for 10 years was gone.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I was able to make it clear as I said to her, "I can't go back to Japan only for your 4-day hospitalization.<br>
Take care of yourself on your own. I can't leave my husband alone.<br>
I already made up my mind that I will live in the US in the rest of my life, so please don't count on me all the time."<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then I argued with my mother. But arguments are necessary if you walk on the Buddha’s path.<br>
You have to say what you have to say!<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Being a Shinnyo follower doesn't mean I have to always be obedient.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
With the determination of becoming a bridge of the Shinnyo Teaching, I was able to become tough!<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
I'd like to share this story especially with young followers who have some difficulties to have a "joku-bodai" with their lineage parent.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
You cannot solve your problem by yourself alone. The Buddha always shows you the way to solve your problem.<br>

Thank you for listening.<br>
