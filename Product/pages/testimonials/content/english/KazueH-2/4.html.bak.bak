 When I finally  started to practice wishing to be of help to others, I got on bad terms  with my son; and since  my younger daughter had gone off to college, I  decided to move to live in an apartment by myself.<br>
<br>
 I worked from morning till night.<br>
<br>
 Whenever I found a little time, I would go to the temple.<br>
<br>
 It was the time when we were practicing towards the reassembly of Shinchoji, returning to the origin of the teaching and conveying to others the path Soya-sama (Shinnyo Parents) underwent.<br>
<br>
 I made the determination to protect the teaching and follow after Keishu-sama's footsteps.<br>
<br>
 I prayed with gratitude and joy and received elevation to Daikangi.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then one day, I received a letter from my mother.<br>
<br>
 My half brothers had gotten married, so she wanted me to forget about them.<br>
<br>
 It was the same mother who had said before that she didn't regret giving birth to me.<br>
<br>
 As I wrote letters of anger several times, I started to understand how my mother felt.<br>
<br>
 It must have been hard for her to write this letter and I felt pity for my mother who had to worry about her son and his wife.<br>
<br>
 Now, I have come to feel I will just wait for the day when I will be able to see her again.<br>
<br>
 Looking back, my fourteen years at the institution had given me the strength to over come anything and to be friends with anyone.<br>
<br>
 But moreover, I was able to obtain the feeling of having gratitude to everything through the Shinnyo teaching.<br>
<br>
 In a sesshin I received awhile back, I was indicated that the family that had fallen apart can get better depending on my practice, just like a flower blossoming on a withered tree.<br>
<br>
 I thought of taking a chance on this possibility.<br>
<br>
 Now, my husband is living by himself, and I live with my eldest daughter who is married, and my son who I had not seen for years because he was put on trial.<br>
<br>
 Thus, we have been able to come together as a happy family living in a house my daughter purchased.<br>
<br>
 I used to think there was nobody more miserable than myself in this whole world.<br>
<br>
 Now, I can say proudly that I am the happiest person on this world.<br>
<br>
<br>
Shinnyo Keishu-sama gave us the opportunity to practice towards the consecration of the spiritual tomb and I wanted to be a part of it too.<br>
<br>
 In Shinnyo Keishu-sama's sermon she mentioned the Shinnyo parents are out father and mother and Ryodoji-sama are our brothers.<br>
<br>
 I felt grateful from my heart and offered gassho.<br>
<br>
 If I am allowed, I would like to be a spiritual medium to become a true server.<br>
<br>
 I am not alone anymore.<br>
<br>
 I have the Shinnyo teaching.<br>
<br>
 I see Shinnyo Keishu-sama staking her life for each of the people toward the Great Vow of the Shinnyo Parents, so I too will vow to practice straightforwardly with gratitude.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much.<br>
