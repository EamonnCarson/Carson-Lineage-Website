It's been 30 years since I was connected to the Shinnyo Teaching.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Many kinds of things happened in those 30 years.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
One of my friends has been diagnosed as depression, and I'm posting a poem that may be able to convey my feelings to him. (Scroll down, please.) <br>
<!--replaced br-->
The 2010 Winter Training will start tomorrow.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I believe that I was able to spend each year with joy because I attended the Winter Training every year.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'm grateful that I had encountered the Shinnyo Teaching.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'd like to share this wonderful Shinnyo Teaching with you all.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
"Dear my friend, no matter what, please stay alive!"<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I'd like to thank you all of you.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Shinnyo Keishu-sama, thank you very much.<br><br><br>
	  
An Ode by an Ancient Coast Guard<br>
<!--replaced br--><br>
Please tell me<br>
If all living things in this world<br>
Are destined to live limited lives,<br>
Is the sea mortal?<br>
Is a mountain mortal?<br>
How about the wind?<br>
Is the sky the same?<br>
Please tell me<br>
<!--replaced br--><br>
I sometimes<br>
Ponder upon the miseries of human lives<br>
Upon the sorrows<br>
Which everybody will equally feel<br>
Upon the agony of life<br>
Upon the sorrow of growing old<br>
Upon the pains of illness<br>
Upon the misery of dying<br>
And upon my present self<br>
<!--replaced br--><br>
Please answer me<br>
If every life of all existences in this world<br>
Has its own destiny,<br>
Is spring mortal?<br>
Is autumn mortal?<br>
Like summer goes<br>
Like winter comes<br>
Must everything pass away?<br>
<!--replaced br--><br>
Can I reckon<br>
On the twinkling of a tiny life<br>
Something like a faint hope<br>
Which cannot be grasped by human words?<br>
Some people are passing<br>
Others are coming<br>
A waning moon<br>
Will be waxing again<br>
In our everyday lives<br>
<!--replaced br--><br>
Please tell me<br>
If all living things in this world<br>
Are destined to live limited lives,<br>
Is the sea mortal?<br>
Is a mountain mortal?<br>
Is spring mortal?<br>
Is autumn mortal?<br>
Is love mortal?<br>
Is the human heart mortal?<br>
Must everything including my beloved home country<br>
Pass away?<br>
