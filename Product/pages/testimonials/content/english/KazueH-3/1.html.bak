I have two mothers.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
One is my birth mother, and the other one is my foster mother.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
It has been 30 years since my foster mother, Principal Miki Sawada passed away.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Last May, I went back to Elizabeth Saunders Home in Japan, where her 30th year memorial service was taking place.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Some incident led her establish Elizabeth Saunders Home, devoting her life, her family and everything she had for the future of the neglected children of mixed race who were born during the post World War II period.
<!-- replaced br -->
<!-- replaced br -->
Who would want to raise children who are not your own? <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Principal Sawada was kind, strong, and sometimes like a feared parent to me and other foster children. Her presence made us feel peaceful.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I had thought that nobody loved me during my life with her for 14 years. Several years after her passing away, I heard how much Principal Sawada had loved me, but I couldn’t believe it.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
She liked lilies so much. The chapel was full of lilies. At the center of the lilies was her smiling face.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When I said to her, "I'm home," tears came and something in my heart snapped.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Several days later, when I attended a Shinnyo-en service, I understood what that <i>something</i> really was.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I hated my life at Elizabeth Saunders Home.  Now I have gratitude toward her.  It is also my repentance for my absence of gratitude.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I didn't want to admit having gratitude toward her, but now I can.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I have joy because I can now say to her from my heart, "Thank you very much for raising me and loving me."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I sometimes remember what she used to say to me, "I believe someday you will become a person who leads people because you can."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
In the second year since I was connected to the Shinnyo Teaching, I received a sesshin. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
"Why was I born as a mixed race child even though I'm a Japanese?" I asked.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
The spiritual words: That's because the Buddha chose me to become a person whom all the people who are worried, who are suffering, and who are sad can rely on, and the Buddha believes I can.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I used to be a person who couldn’t trust anybody.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Now the Shinnyo Teaching made me a person who has tears of joy and gratitude in my heart.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
As a sono-uta reads: <i>"Though human, we are bodhisattvas when we dedicate ourselves for others,"</i> Principal Sawada didn't think of herself, but she prayed for the children's happiness.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
On another day, when I was asked, "If you are reborn as a human again, who would you like to be your mother?" I answered, "My birth mother."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I used to hate and I used to have a grudge toward my birth mother. However, I came to think like this: Because of her, I was born into this world and was eventually able to encounter the Shinnyo Teaching. <br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Here I'd like to show my gratitude again.  I'm very thankful for being protected by my ancestors, by my family, and by people around me.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Whenever I am going through a hard time, I read those sono-utas:<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
<i>Pray earnestly and devotedly with utmost sincerity. If this is done, no matter how heavy the burden of karma might be, it would be sure to be eliminated.</i><br>
<!-- replaced br -->
<i>Should anything turn to the worse, accept it complacently. Open the eyes of wisdom and see the brightness ahead.</i><br>
<!-- replaced br -->
<i>Make the mind of faith immovable and adamant.</i><br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I have made up my mind: Whatever happens, I will do my best to protect Shinnyo Keishu-sama and the Shinnyo Teaching.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Gratitude – I became to be able to comprehend it through many "riburai (spiritual indications)."<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
When you'd like to convey your gratitude toward someone, please try to say "Thank you," with your courage.<br>
<!-- replaced br --> 
Then your heart will be clear, and you will understand the meaning of being kept alive.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
Thank you.<br>
