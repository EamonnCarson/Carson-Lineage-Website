I would like to share a miracle that I experienced this summer.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
It’s about my son.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  In the middle of June, 2010 he started to complain about the discomfort he felt from the tip of his index finger and his thumb.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 The discomfort was caused by it swelling there on and off.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 However, there wasn’t any itchiness or pain along with it.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
I didn’t take his symptom seriously because I thought it was swollen just from playing the Nintendo Wii a lot.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
In early July, my mother in law visited my place and my son insistently begged her to let him spend a night at her house.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  He usually asks her whether he can spend a night at her house or not but that time was he was being unusually persistent.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
He spent a night at my mother in law’s house the day before the 4th of July and I went to pick him up the next day.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  When I got to my mother in law’s house, she mentioned that something wrong with his urine so she suggested me to take him to the doctor.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  She was worried because of the possibility of him having diabetes.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
The next day I made an appointment with his doctor and took him to the hospital.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
The results were negative and I felt relief from my anxiety.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  In later indications, this event meant a big wakeup call from the spiritual world to me.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 When I took him to the doctor, I forgot to ask about his swollen problem because it had calmed down and there were no signs of any swollenness.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  However, after we saw his doctor, it started again but appeared to be more serious than before.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  He showed me his foot which had a big bump and I thought he had hit his foot somewhere.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 He said the bump didn’t hurt, even when I pressed it.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  Then a couple of hours later, the tip of his index finger and the knuckle of his middle finger began to swell badly.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 Every time when he has this symptom, the swollenness disappeared the next day.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  However, other parts of his hands or feet would swell in the evening but disappear in the morning.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
 This was really strange.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  One day, his index finger and the foot remained swollen so I took him to the hospital to show the symptom to his doctor.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  After I told the doctor about his symptom and showed her some pictures I took for evidence, his doctor said that she had never seen such a symptom in her long medical experiences.<br>
<!-- replaced br -->
  She also took some pictures to show her colleagues to receive second opinions and ordered some blood tests.<br>
