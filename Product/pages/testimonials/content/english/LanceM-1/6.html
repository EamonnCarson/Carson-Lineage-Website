It is like riding a bicycle as a kid. <br>

You see everyone else doing it so you want to also.<br>

But when you fall off that first time, then you have to decide; ride or not.<br>

That is when you really decide if you "want" to ride a bike, or not.<br>

I fell off the Shinnyo "bike," and I have decided that I want to ride even more that my first time.<br>



I do not want my children to be overcome by the same karma, and I have learned that Shinnyo-en is the True Path.<br>

My outlook on life is full of sunshine since I have found the path, and as I watch my "beacon," and Sooya-sama, Ryodoji-sama, Shinnyo Keishu-sama, and the Guardians of the Law, I am very sorry for what
 I have done.<br>

For my lineage parents & lineage members, the lineage parents at this temple, for the Office staff, and my family (here, and in Japan), I will try to stay on the path, and to purify my karma and to serve as your foundation.<br>

There are people here, and in Japan who did not give up on me, and to those people I want to offer gassho for I might not be here today if it were not for you and your Buddha nature pulling me out of hell.<br>
