However, the mention of my uncle kept my attention, and I called my mother in Japan to ask about him. <br>
 <br>
She told me that there seem to have been a lot of problems but it should be fine now.<br>
<br>
Since my mother isn’t in close contact with my uncle’s family, she doesn’t know much about their situation. <br>
<br>
I told my mother what happened that day.  <br>
<br>
And I asked her if I could call my aunt and ask her about it, since the sesshin words really struck my mind.  <br>
<br>
My mother told me that I should go ahead and call my aunt and gave me her phone number. <br>
<br>
So I called. <br>
<br>
It was the very first time for me to call this aunt, so she didn’t recognize me at first. <br>
<br>
I talked about my uncle and asked her if everything was OK.  <br>
<br>
She told me that she’s at a loss because of so many things going on. <br>
<br>
She said that her birth family’s religion was Shingon Buddhism, so she was thinking about requesting the special prayer for her second son.  <br>
<br>
When I mentioned to her about uncle being mentioned in my sesshin, she listened to me and told me that she believed it.  <br>
<br>
Gaining confidence from her reply, I told her a little about Shinnyo-en.<br>
 <br>
I told her that my mother should have some Nirvana issues at home, and she could borrow them if she would like. <br>
<br>
And if she felt like going to Shinnyo-en, I offered to do the necessary paperwork for her.  <br>
<br>
And I hung up the phone. <br>
<br>
Soon, time for the Spring Higan came around. <br>
<br>
Since it coincided with Easter this year, I did not attend the Spring Higan Service. <br>
<br>
Instead, we visited the mother-in-law’s with everybody else. <br>
<br>
Before we met my brother-in-law’s family, my mother-in-law told us that the nieces’ graduation was to start at 9AM.  <br>
<br>
Since we must leave the house by 8a.m., we were told to stay there overnight from the previous day. <br>
<br>
Because I heard from my guiding parent that many high school graduations start in the afternoon or later in the day, I knew at that point that I should give up the Eza. <br>
<br>
Even my mother-in-law said she was surprised to hear about the graduation ceremony held so early in the day. <br>
<br>
But since we don’t have many close family or relatives, she told us that everybody should go.  <br>
<br>
I thought, “Oh no, that’s problem.” But I couldn’t object to her. <br>
<br>
After dinner, I thought even if I can’t attend Eza, at least I could invite everyone for the service on 18th.  <br>
<br>
And I told my mother-in-law and sister-in-law about that.   <br>
<br>
They listened to me but did not give me any definite answer. <br>
<br>
I wasn’t expecting immediate response, so I didn’t think much about it. <br>
<br>
My mother-in-law is a member of a Presbyterian church and my brother-in-law’s family is Catholic.  <br>
<br>
So, I didn’t think they would have any particular interest in other religions.  <br>
<br>
After coming home following the Easter dinner, I still remembered about my aunt in Japan and called my mother.  <br>
<br>
She told me that, as is the customary case, my aunt drove my mother to go to the family graves at a temple for the Higan visit. <br>
<br>
My aunt didn’t ask my mother for anything.  <br>
<br>
But since I had previously asked my mother to give some Nirvana issues to my aunt if she contacted, my mother put some Nirvana’s in a bag and handed them to my aunt discretely in another relative’s presence.  <br>    
<br>
