<b>Words of Gratitude</b>(August 6, 2010)<br>
<!--replaced br-->
I feel very fortunate to have this opportunity in which I can convey my gratitude on the day of Shojushin'in-sama's memorial.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
In January 2006, I was diagnosed with depression and hospitalized for one week.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Later, sesshin indicated the deep sorrow of a male ancestor on my husband's side who died in a fire.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
My father-in-law told me that there was a man on my husband's father's side who lost his wife and children in an accident. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
He was so shocked and depressed that he committed suicide by pouring gasoline on himself and setting himself on fire.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
He also told me that there was a family on my husband's mother's side who all died in a fire in their apartment.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Even after I was released from the hospital, I had to see a counselor regularly and had to take medications every day.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
I continued this for one and a half years.  The reasons for my depression were my unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and laziness.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
Also, I was very disappointed back then that my three guiding children moved overseas far from Shinnyo-en right after they had finally started receiving sesshin.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
And to add to that, I had negative feelings against my husband because he was reluctant to practice the Shinnyo Teaching.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
<!--replaced br-->
On August 2007, my husband's parents in New York planned a trip to Italy for a family reunion and asked my family to join them.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
So I decided to go and travel to Italy.  At first, we visited the Vatican, which is the center of Catholicism, and then went to a small village in Sicily where my husband's ancestors are from.  I felt relaxed there. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I found out the man who set himself on fire had also lived in this village. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
We saw a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus in a portable shrine at the village's sacred place.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
The statue reminded me of a photograph of Shojushin'in-sama holding her baby Kyodoin-sama. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
My depression was finally gone after I returned from the trip to Italy. <br>
