12 days later, I put step on the US soil in the first time.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  Several years later, I got married to a American man and settled down in the US.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I finally got pregnant after all 6 years and had a baby.<br>

  Whenever I reflect on that my family in Japan and I had never imagined such a life I'm having now,  I always have the feeling of Shinnyo Kyoshu-sama's (Shinjo Ito's) hand with his words, "Try your best there."<br>

Last year in May, the Shinnyo-en Head Temple was consecrated in Redwood City, and since then I go to that temple.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  In the temple, I experience the "Shinnyo Meditation.<br>

In the many years of my unique way of walking, my right pinky toe bended.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 It became diffcult to walk due to the pain from the toe.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 I underwent surgery on my right pinky toe in 2005.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  From that period, my body was getting weak.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 I sometimes walked with a cane.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I went to a gym for exercise, but it only made me feel tired.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  And I couldn't continue it.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  At last, I was having the trouble of picking up something on the floor.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 I felt heavy.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I felt tired, though I had enough sleep.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I was almost falling down several times on flat areas.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I was getting unable to sit on my legs folded under (the Japanese style sitting).<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  Even in such difficult times, I didn't have any of "those pains."<br>
<!--replaced br-->
In 2008, when I was walking briskly with stuff in both of my hands, I stumbled and fell down.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  That incident made me realize, "I'm getting weak."<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 Even though Kyoshu-sama (Shinjo Ito) took the pains away from my leg, it would be a shame that if I become unable to walk again.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
 I see the power of bakku-daiju made me meet you, who have specialties in Preventive Medicine, Neuromuscular Therapy, Fitness Coaching, and Nutrition Coaching.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
  I'm amazed that I "can" do what you instruct me to do.<br>
