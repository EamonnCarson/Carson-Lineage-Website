I am 10 years old.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
It all started when I was moving from RedWood City, my brother Lennon was born too.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
While I was growing up, I had some hard times with my family and had lots of stress.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
But I always remembered how Kyoshu-sama lived and how hard my parents worked.<br>
<!--replaced br-->
They worked so hard. When ever I get sad, I always chant the Goreiju. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It always calms me. So I go to Shinnyo-en and that makes me so happy! <br>
<!--replaced br-->
When I had my first Sesshin.....I was sooooooo nervous I thought I could faint! <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Then I thought about Kyoshu-sama and Shojushin'in-sama, and I was relaxed. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
When I heard the news.........I just couldn't express it with words. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It's like a feeling when someone says "Welcome back." <br>
<!--replaced br-->
To you or, when you figure out that you can retire or when, you are spending time with your family.<br>
<!--replaced br--> 
Like that kind of feeling. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
It's like you want to cry tears of joy. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
That's what I feel like every time I go to Shinnyo En. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
I think that everyone can feel that too. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
If we all work together and with the help of Kyoshu-sama, we can all make a difference. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Thank you for your time and participation in reading this proof. <br>
<!--replaced br-->
Thank you very much.<br>
