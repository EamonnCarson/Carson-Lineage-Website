As soon as they agreed, they said to the messenger from Kosala, "We have chosen the bride from our loyal family. Please take her with you."<br>
When Vasabhakhattiya arrived at Savatthi, King Pasenadi was very pleased and held a huge ceremony. <br>
He loved her so much that he made her the first wife.<br>
Soon after she became pregnant and she gave birth to a baby boy who was radiant.<br>
The boy would become Prince Virudhaka (Crystal One).<br>
He healthily grew up and when he was 16 years old, this sensitive young man wanted to see his mother's homeland.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Mother, I'd like to see your father," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Oh, why do you want to go there suddenly?<br>
</p>
<p>
Why don't you make an official request, then visit there?" said his mother.<br>
</p>
<p>
"I really want to go there. I also asked my father about it. Whatever it takes, I will definitely visit to see him."<br>
</p>
<p>
As she realized that she could not stop him, she sent an urgent secret letter to the Shakya clan:<br>
"I have an easy life in this country. I'd like to ask you all not to leak to him any secret about my background."<br>
</p>
<p>
The people in the Shakya clan started discussing bewilderingly.<br>
"Hey, the son of that woman will visit us from Kosala.<br>
We, honorable Shaka clan, cannot show such a guy our respects.<br>
Let's move all our children to the countryside."
