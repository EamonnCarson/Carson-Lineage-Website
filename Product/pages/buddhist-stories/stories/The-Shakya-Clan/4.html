When the Prince Virudhaka and his men arrived at Kapilavastu the capital of the Shakya clan, all of his relatives already gathered in the public hall.<br>
"This one is your grandfather."<br>
"That one is your uncle."<br>
</p>
<p>
As being introduced one by one, Prince Virudhaka bowed back to each one of them and greeted politely.<br>
But weirdly no one greeted him properly.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Why did not anybody greet me properly?" He asked one of the relatives.<br>
"Well, in this country the younger must greet politely the elders.<br>
Today, all the people younger than you went to the countryside.<br>
I'm sorry, but please accept their regards, too."<br>
</p>
<p>
Prince Virudhaka felt that somewhat he was not welcomed.<br>
He stayed there without satisfaction for several days and then started heading home.<br>
Then one of his men went back to the city because he had left something there. <br>
At the public hall, some servants (slaves) were washing the chair Virudhata had sat on with milk-mixed water for purification.<br>
