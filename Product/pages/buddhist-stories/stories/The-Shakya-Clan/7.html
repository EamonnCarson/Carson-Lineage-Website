However, among the people who were discontent with the aging King and Prince Jeta, who became docile by believing in the Buddha, there were quite a few who had sympathy on Virudhaka.<br>
</p>
<p>
One day, King Pasenadi, on the way home from an expedition, felt like he was eager to see the Buddha, so he held an army camp near the Grove and visited the Buddha with a few of his men.<br>
"Well, the Buddha, I'm very glad to see you again.<br>
We are both almost 80 years old. We need to take care of our health..."<br>
</p>
<p>
While they were talking for hours an army commander stole the King Flag and gave it to Virudhaka, then Virudhaka retrieved the army.<br>
"He's such an ungrateful child. Thus, I will ask my nephew Ajasatatru to send his army and catch Virudhaka."<br>
</p>
<p>
Pasenadha now under the circumstances, and then he headed for Rajavatti using all his effort for several days.<br>
When he finally reached the gate of the castle, he was so exhausted that, also due to the emotional shock, he became delirious with fever and died.<br>
After Virudhaka gained the throne, he expanded the army, and then he and his huge army went to the state of the Shakya clan as his heart was burning for revenge.<br>
</p>
<p>
"I will kill all of the Shakya clan, none shall live."<br>
