The Buddha, meditating during his morning routine in his garden (the Bamboo Grove), sensed that evil feeling and saw the actions of Virudhaka by his clairvoyance.<br>
"Unfortunately, the time finally has come. I have to stop him."<br>
</p>
<p>
He stood up and headed in a hurry to the road that led to Kapilavastu from Kosala.<br>
When he reached the border, he sat under a dying tree even though there were many tree with a lot of leaves in the Kosala side.<br>
Soon after, King Virudhaka and his army approached.<br>

As the King noticed the Buddha, he stopped his army, walked toward the Buddha, and prayed in front of him because he had not lost all respect and gratitude to the Buddha.<br>
</p>
<p>
"The Buddha, even though the sun is shinning brightly, why are you sitting under such a dying tree that has only a few leaves? Please sit under that nigroda tree that have enough leaves." <br>
When Virudhaka politely asked the Buddha, he received unexpected answer:<br>
</p>
<p>
"King Virudhaka, please do not mind me. Even though the tree has only a few leaves, it is cool enough under the homeland's tree."<br>
This stunned the King.<br>
</p>
<p>
"I see. The Buddha was sitting there to protect the Shakya clan."
