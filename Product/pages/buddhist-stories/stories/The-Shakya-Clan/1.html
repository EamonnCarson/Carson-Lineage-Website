Once upon a time when the Buddha was alive...<br>
</p>
<p>
In those days, India was, unlike it is today, composed of 16 major countries and several other countries.<br>
Among these major countries, Magadha in the South and Kosala in the North were growing strong enough to oppress the other countries.<br>
The country of the Shakya clan was located in the Northern India and it was one of the small countries under Kosala domination. (The Buddha was from the Shakya clan.)<br>

<p>
King Bimbisara of Magadha was an enthusiastic follower of the Buddha and he donated the Bamboo Grove to the Buddha. He also made his wife Khema a nun.<br>
In his last years, he lost his power by a coup carried out by his son Prince Ajasatatru.<br>
And Prince Ajasatatru's mother was a sister of King Pasenadi of Kosala.<br>
King Pasenadi, persuaded by his wife and retainers, gradually believed in Buddhism and later he came to visit the Buddha every day.<br>
One of his princes, Jeta, convinced by a wealthy man Sudatta, also donated Jeta's Grove (Jpn: Gion-shoja) to the Buddha.<br>
Thus, the Buddhism spread in Kosala and a lot of Buddhist students were there.<br>
</p>
<p>
At the castle in Savatthi (the capital of Kosala), the officials donated excellent foods to the Buddhist students, but they did not stay long at the castle. <br>
Instead, they felt comfortable eating at the houses of the believers at Buddhism.<br>
One day King Pasenadi came up an idea.
