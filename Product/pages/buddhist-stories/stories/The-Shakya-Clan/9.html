<p>
When he realized it, he prayed for the Buddha and returned to Savatthi with his army.<br>
A few days after this, however, his feeling for revenge came back and he moved his army for invasion.<br>
But again when he found the Buddha sitting under the dying tree, he retrieved the army.<br>
And several days passed, Virudhaka started the third attempt of invasion of his army.<br>
However, the Buddha was again sitting under the dying tree.<br>
When Virudhaka saw the Buddha, he could not help but returning.<br>
</p>
<p>
Then at the fourth time he moved his army as he was moved by an unstopping need for revenge.<br>
At that moment the Buddha in the Grove went into a deep meditation and observed in details what the Shakya clan had done.<br>
He saw that the fruit of the bad deeds that the Shakya clan had committed since long ago, like killing many animals and humans, had ripened enough (to the limit).<br>
The Shakya clan were the outstanding people, but they were also snobbish and despised others, thus this kind of karma had not been purified.<br>
</p>
<p>
Even the Buddha could not change the law of karma just for his personal reason.<br>
This time he did not move his body (to save the Shakya clan).<br>
</p>
<p>
Kosala's huge army finally crossed the border and invaded the Shakya Clan's territory and went up to the capital and started killing the people.<br>
When the army broke into the castle, Mahamaha stood in front of Virudhaka because he felt a huge responsibility by facing his clan's tragedy.<br>
</p>
<p>
"King Virudhaka, as you know, your mother is my daughter," Mahamaha said.<br>
"Thus, I am your grandfather. Please stop any more killings for my sake."
