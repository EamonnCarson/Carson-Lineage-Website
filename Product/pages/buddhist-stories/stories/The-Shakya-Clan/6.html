<p>
They returned to Savatthi, the King heard the story and became very mad.<br>
"Ugh! The Shakya clan gave me a daughter of a slave."<br>
</p>
<p>
He grabbed Vasabhakhattiya and Virudhaka, and shut them up within a room for servants (slaves).<br>
"You deserve this for your rank."<br>
</p>
<p>
The King could not help but doing so due to consideration of the public.<br>
But after this unfortunate incident, the Buddha visited Sarvatthi.<br>
The King told him about the incident and how he felt.<br>
The Buddha admitted the Shakya clan's fault.<br>
Also he explained the justification of Virudhata and his mother and persuaded the King that his action was wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>
The King's mind at last became clear when he understood the Buddha's heart.<br>
"Yes, I only need to consider Virudhaka's father's lineage."<br>
The King pulled himself together and gave back Virudhaka and his mother the original positions and put their life back to what it was before.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Virudhaka's heart was never clear.<br>
He hated his father and mother. He hated the Shakya clan the most.<br>
His mind was degenerating and his wild temper became violent.
