After Upaka considered for a moment, he replied, "Venerable One, it may be so..." <br>
</p>
<p>
He reluctantly left this mysterious monk and went another way.<br>
This monk, however, was surely indeed the Buddha, who was heading to the place where the Dhama Wheel would be first turned.<br>
What if, even having doubts, Upaka had followed the Buddha?<br>
He could have listened to the Buddha's very first sermon with the five disciples at Deer Park in Sarnath.<br>
Or even though he might not have been able to understand the teaching soon, at least he could have been the honorable first disciple of the Buddha.<br>
Unfortunately, Upaka missed such a wonderful opportunity in front of his eyes.<br>
</p>
<p>
But it was reasonable for him. The time might have not been ripe yet.<br>
After that, Upaka had continued his training based on the teachings of Makkhali Gosala while wandering several places.<br>
Even as time passed, however, he could not get any distinguished achievement.<br>
Thus, he was not sure if it was better to keep continuing his training.<br>

<p>
"Is it not possible to obtain true bliss and eternal happiness in the carnal world?"<br>
</p>
<p>
Feeling deadlocked, he kept wandering and he drifted to a village of hunters in Vankahara.<br>
The hunters were religious and welcomed the ascetic very well with their respects, Upaka decided to stay and practice there.<br>
Could he get his answer?
