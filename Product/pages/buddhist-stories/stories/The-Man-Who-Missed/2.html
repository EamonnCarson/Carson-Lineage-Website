<p>
His face was bright and his eyes were clear as if they could absorb Upaka. <br>
Seeing that the monk was not an ordinary man, Upaka addressed him.<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Venerable One, your countenance is clear and serene and your complexion is pure and bright. You seem to have followed a good path.
Who is your teacher? Or what teaching do you follow?"<br>
</p>
<p>
The monk's answer was far beyond Upaka's expectation:<br>
</p>
<p>
 	 "I am one who has overcome all and knows all.<br>
I am detached from all things and I have abandoned worldly desires.<br>
I have no teacher.<br>
I am the only one in the world who has fully and completely enlightened.<br>
I am the teacher supreme.<br>
My heart is pure and filled with peace.<br>
I now go to the Kasi to turn the Wheel of Dharma (teachings), and I shall beat the drum of immortality for the world of blind beings."<br>
</p>
<p>
Upaka was so impressed by the monk's overwhelming assurance and decisive attitude that he said, "Venerable One, you seem to be the Victorious One."<br>
Then the monk told him, "He who has thrown away delusions of all kinds could be a victorious one like me in life, Upaka."<br>

 What Upaka was told was unbelievable for him.<br>
Upaka thought:<br>
</p>
<p>
Does it happen that such a revered one appears and approaches me?<br>
Just because a stranger says, "I am the fully enlightened one," who is such an idiot to say, "Yes, I will be your disciple"?<br>
But in fact, it seems a halo is visible around his body.<br>
Well, he must be an honorable man more or less anyway.<br>
But I cannot believe he is a Buddha supreme.<br>
After all, he is still young and he has no disciple and no followers.<br>
He may have a tendency to exaggerate things...
