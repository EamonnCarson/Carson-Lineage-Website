Even after reaching to the enlightenment, Chullapantaka couldn't manage to follow the complicated discussion, but he had the excellent divine power.<br>
One day the Buddha was invited by King Pasenadi of Kosala Kingdom, so he and his disciples left to the king's castle. <br>
When Chullapantaka with the Buddha's bowl was at the end of the line of the disciples, the guards of the castle who had heard that he was a kind of dumb blocked him at the gate to tease him.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Now recite a verse. If you don't recite fluently, you might be a fake disciple, and we cannot let you in."<br>
</p>
<p>
"I don't mind, but without this bowl, the Buddha won't be able to receive the offering. I need to hand it to him."<br>
</p>
<p>
After he responded, his body stood still there but his arms with his hands holding the bowl expanded into the inside of the castle.<br>
Finally his arms reached to the Buddha, who was talking with King Pasenadi.<br>

The king was surprised. "The Buddha, whose hands are they!?"<br>
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry, your majesty. They are Chullapantaka's, one of my disciples. It looks like he handed me the bowl from the outside of the gate."<br>
</p>
<p>
"Since he is such a disciple with a wondrous power, I'd like provide him the offering myself."<br>
</p>
<p>
Thus Chullapantaka received the several offerings from King Pasenadi.
