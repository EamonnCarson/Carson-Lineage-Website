<p>
Once upon a time when the Buddha was aliveâ€¦<br>
</p>
<p>
A daughter of a wealthy merchant in Rajagaha, the capital of Magadha, fell in love with a young servant. <br>
Of course, under the caste system, a love between a young man from the Sudras and a rich man's daughter would never be allowed.<br>
</p>
<p>
"If Father and Mother become to know about us, they would kill us. Let's get away to a country far away."<br>
</p>
<p>
The young man made up his mind by her words. They left the house together and drifted to an unknown land.<br>
Soon she became pregnant, and she reached the last month of the pregnancy.<br>
</p>
<p>
"I'm worried about giving birth here because there is nobody we know around us. I'd like to give birth at my parents' house."<br>
</p>
<p>
"I understand. Let's leave tomorrow."<br>
</p>
<p>
Even though the husband responded like this, he seemed to be reluctant.<br>
He only responded the same for days. <br>
One morning, she made up her mind, and she left alone toward Rajagaha.<br>
The husband later found out that she was gone, and he ran after her.<br>
When he caught up with her on the way to Rajagaha, she suddenly began labor and she gave birth to a baby body on the spot.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Because the baby was born, we don't need to go to my parents' house. Let's go home."<br>
</p>
<p>
After they returned home, they started thinking about the name for the baby.
