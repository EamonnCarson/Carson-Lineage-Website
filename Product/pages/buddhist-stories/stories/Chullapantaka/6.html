The white cloth was getting darker and darker because how many times he wiped their feet, each time they had gone out, they had come back with their dirty feet.<br>
</p>
<p>
He thought, "I sweep off the dust. I remove the dirt." <br>
The darker the cloth got, he felt the whiter and purer his heart became.<br>
"How amazing the cloth that the Buddha gave me is! <br>
I'm just wiping their feet but I feel like the dirt of my heart is also getting away." <br>
He became joyful and prayed the Buddha while reciting, "I sweep off the dust. I remove the dirt."<br>
</p>
<p>
"I see, the dust means the dust in one's heart, and the dirt means the dirt in one's heart. <br>
What one has to take away are the dust and the dirt in one's heart." <br>
When he understood it, a light went to into his heart and he felt that the dust and the dirt were wiped away.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Buddha sensed it and talked to him.<br>
"That's right, Chullapantaka. The dust means the dust in your heart, and the dirt means the dirt in your heart." <br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The dust and the dirt, no matter how dirty they appear,
Are not else dirtier than impureness in one's heart.<br>
Greed, anger, and ignorance, by throwing away them,<br>
A holy person lives in the pure teaching.</i><br>

When the poem that the Buddha recited echoed in his soul, all the delusions went away from his heart and he had reached the enlightenment of Arhat that was filled with steady peace and full of joy.
