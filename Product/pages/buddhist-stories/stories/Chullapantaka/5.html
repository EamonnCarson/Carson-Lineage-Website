<p>
Chullapantaka was at a loss.<br>
"Oh, no. I have no hope since Mahapantaka has given up me. <br>
He did not know what to do. He was reluctant to leave the temple.<br>
He did not want to, so he hesitated to leave at a corner of the yard and was very sad.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Chullapantaka, what are you doing here?" <br>
</p>
<p>
Chullapantaka turned his head with a surprise, he saw the Buddha standing there.<br>
</p>
<p>
"Oh Buddha, I'm too dumb to memorize even one verse. Even my brother gave up me. I was thinking to go home." <br>
</p>
<p>
"Chullapantaka, you came here by my permission. Since your brother gave up you, why don't you come with me? Come with me."<br>
</p>
<p>
The Buddha took Chullapantaka to his Bamboo Grove and gave him a piece of white cloth.<br>
</p>
<p>
"From now on, you wipe the feet of the monks coming back to the temple while you say 'I sweep off the dust. I remove the dirt.' This will be your training."<br>
</p>
<p>
"The Buddha, I won't be able to memorize that." <br>
</p>
<p>
"Don't worry. I will ask them to recite with you."<br>
</p>
<p>
Thus, Chullapantaka recited, "I sweep off the dust. I remove the dirt" and wiped their feet with the cloth day by day.<br>
