So, when Chullapantaka was enjoying the stage of the enlightenment in his state of samadhi, the Buddha and his 500 disciples left the temple to receive the dinner offering hosted by a respected doctor, Jivaka.<br>
When everybody sat on the each seat and the food was about to be brought, the Buddha said, "Jivaka, there is still a good Arhat in the temple. Can you bring him here?"<br>
The disciples did not know Chullapantaka had reached to the enlightenment, and they said, "The Buddha, there is no one left in the temple."<br>
However, just in a case, a messenger went to the temple.<br>
</p>
<p>
When Chullapantaka knew the messenger was coming, he used his divine power and created the one thousand incarnations of disciples. <br>
So many disciples stunned the messenger. <br>
</p>
<p>
"Who are you people?" asked the messenger?<br>
</p>
<p>
Then the one thousand monks responded together:<br>
"I am Chullapantaka, an Arhat who knows the Teachings of the Buddha."<br>
</p>
<p>
The messenger was scared. He quickly went back and reported to the Buddha.<br>
"Ha, ha, ha. I see. Well, go there again and call 'Chullapantaka,' then grab the hand of the person who responds first and take him here."<br>
When the messenger, as he was told, grabbed the hand of the disciple that responded, the other disciples disappeared and Chullapantaka was left.<br>
</p>
<p>
When Chullapantaka was taken to Jivaka's house, they praised him and he received the warm dinner offering.
