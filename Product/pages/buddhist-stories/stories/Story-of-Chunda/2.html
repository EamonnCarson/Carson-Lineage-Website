	Then, a lay follower stood up in front of the Buddha. <br>
	He was Chunda, a blacksmith. Carrying his offerings, he hurried there with his fifteen friends to whom he had conveyed the teachings. <br>
	He deeply bowed and praised the Buddha. Then he asked the Buddha with tears: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"World Honored One, with your compassion, please accept these last offerings, though they are small and meager, with your disciples. <br>
	If you are gone, we will be without refuge and without salvation. We shall be at a loss. <br>
	In order to save all beings, please rain down the sweet dharma dew on our poor souls so that we would receive the treasure of the teachings to cut away our hardships." <br>

	After the World Honored One listened to that, He looked into Chunda and addressed him: <br>
</p>
<p>
	"Excellent, excellent! I will now root out this poverty for you and rain down the unsurpassed dharma dew upon your fields, causing the dharma to sprout and grow there. <br>
	Chunda, there are two types of food offering that bring great merits:<br>
	Firstly, it is when you make offering to one who is attaining the unsurpassed complete Enlightenment.<br>
	Secondly, it is when you make offering to one who is entering into Nirvana. <br>
	I will now receive your very last offerings and let you accomplish danaparamita (making offerings)."<br>
