Chunda continued: <br>
</p>
<p>
"If one has the correct view, then he says that the Tathagata is never-changing, eternal, and unconditional. <br>
If one is a bodhisattva who protects the dharma, he would rather give up his life than say that the Tathagata is changing, varying, and conditional. <br>
If he says that the Tathagata is unconditional, then without seeking it, he would attain enlightenment. <br>
Manjusri, a heretic says that the Tathagata is the same as all phenomena. Then that is a deluded statement. <br>
It should be known that upon death this person would enter the hell as his own home. <br>
Manjusri, if you feel deeply ashamed yourself, you should abandon such deficient understanding and seek the correct knowledge." <br>
</p>
<p>
Manjusri flinched at Chunda's furious argument. <br>
One might have been mad when being told in that way. <br>
</p>
<p>
But, a great-bodhisattva as he was, he wasn't carried away by emotion, rather he praised Chunda, saying, <br>
</p>
<p>
"Excellent, excellent! You have now created the causes and conditions for a long life span. <br>
Since you are able to understand that the Tathagata is eternally abiding, unchanging, and unconditional, you have now well overturned the physical, secular views about the Tathagata. <br>
Because of this merit you have just gained, it is not long now before you will realize the Arhat's perfect enlightenment. <br>
We shall together overturn such wrong views among the people. <br>
But now let us stop the debate, and you may hurry presenting the very last offerings of foods. <br>
Thus, without hesitation, quickly giving the offering is the consummation of the perfection of danaparamita (making offering). <br>
See, the Tathagata shall enter parinirvana soon." <br>
</p>
<p>
Though the debate seemed to be over, since Chunda still couldn't accept some of the words in Manjusri's speech, he started refuting again.
