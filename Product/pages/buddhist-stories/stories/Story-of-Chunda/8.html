At that time, the World Honored One emitted a variety of lights from his facial orifices and these lights lit around Him. <br>
Encountering these lights, Manjusri then knew the meaning of this incident and addressed Chunda, saying, <br>
</p>
<p>
    "Chunda, as you saw it, it will not be long before He must enter into Nirvana. <br>
"The World Honored One considers now is the time to present the very last offerings you have prepared for Him." <br>
</p>
<p>
The World Honored One nodded His consent, and Chunda looked at His face, then Chunda's heart swelled with grief, though he had seemed calm till now, he could not help but start sobbing. <br>
The World Honored One saw Chunda sobbing and He spoke to him: <br>
</p>
<p>
    "Do not have sorrow, Chunda. You must receive immovable merit because I am the supreme source of merit for all sentient beings. <br>
"If you'd like to be a good source of merit to serve all beings, it is now time to make the very last offerings" <br>
</p>
<p>
Even though Chunda realized and understood, as he loved the Buddha like his father, the Buddha's departure from this world was so hard and sorrowful for him. <br>
Chunda and his friends could do nothing but prepare the very last offerings through their tears.
