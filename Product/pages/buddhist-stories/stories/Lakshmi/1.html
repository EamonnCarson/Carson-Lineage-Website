This is a story that was given by the Buddha when, a long time ago, he had conducted his last teaching under the sala tree.<br>
After he had taught his disciples about birth (life), old age, sickness, and death, he started telling Mahakassapa the following story:<br>
</p>
<p>
One day, a very beautiful woman whom no body had ever seen before in that town visited a wealthy man's house.<br>
When the wealthy man saw the woman, he was suspicious and asked her,<br>
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, but who are you?"<br>
"My name is Lakshmi."<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition to her beautiful face, the woman was radiant and wearing necklaces, bracelets, and earrings on her that were made of several kinds of jewels.<br>
The man asked again,<br>
</p>
<p>
"So, regarding what kind of business have you come to me?"<br>
 "To bring you wealth.<br>
Wherever I visit, they will be blessed with treasures such as gold, silver, sapphires, crystals, pearls, corals, and rubies.<br>
Furthermore, even elephants, horses, cars, and servants."<br>
</p>
<p>
The man was excited to hear that.<br>
</p>
<p>
"She must be a goddess of wealth. Luck is finally smiling upon me."<br>
He politely welcomed her by scattering the flagrant flowers around, offering her incense, and praying to her.<br>
Then appeared a poor-looking dirty woman standing at the entryway.<br>
He got out and took a look. The woman looked shabby, ugly, and dirty.
