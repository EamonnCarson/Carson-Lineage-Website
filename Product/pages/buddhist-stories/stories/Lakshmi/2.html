"Who the heck are you? What do you want?" He asked.<br>
</p>
<p>
"My name is Alakshmi. Wherever I go, people will become poor."<br>
</p>
<p>
After he heard that, he became furiously enraged, raised his sword, and said, <br>
"You are a worthless goddess of poverty. Go away or you will die." But the woman said calmly,<br>
"You are such an idiot. You have no wisdom!"<br>
</p>
<p>
He pressed her more to drive her away definitely.<br>
"Why do you say that I am an idiot and have no wisdom? Tell me why. If you are lying, I'll kill you." 
</p>
<p>
 "I tell you. The woman whom you have welcomed to your house and whom you are taking care of is my older sister.
We are always together and we have never separated.
If you drive me away, she will go away, too. 
Do you understand?"<br>
</p>
<p>
Suspicious with the shabby woman's words, he returned to the room quickly and asked Lakshmi about this.<br>
</p>
<p>
 "Yes, she is my younger sister. I forgot to tell you that we are always together. 
 </p>
<p>
I always give fortune and she always gives misfortune.
If you want to take care of me, I'd like you to take care of my sister, too."<br>
His expectation was wrong and he was disappointed.<br>
